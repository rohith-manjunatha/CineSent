       "[\"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!\",\n",
       " \".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n",
       " \"Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus.\",\n",
       " \"Trash beyond anything I could ever imagine. They should give refunds to everyone who went to see this garbage.The most unlikable characters the MCU has ever produced. The movie only has two types of characters: annoying girl-boss and annoying pathetic loser. These characters aren't relatable because these are the type of people you run away from on the street.Let's dump 300million into the CGI vomit machine and hope no one realizes how terrible the movie is. This is the grand strategy behind the geniuses at Marvel. It's sad and pathetic.I'm giving this a 1/10 because it has no value, and I left the theater in a worse state than I went in.\",\n",
       " \"The first two Ant Man movies the quantum realm was talked about, but in Quantumania we now see it first hand. Scott and family find themselves pulled into the quantum realm, only to discover it's also another universe, and Janets past quickly comes back to haunt her.Jonathan Majors really blew me away has the villian Kang, givin a type Darth Vader like performance, even with his calmness you clearly see the insanity in him. Paul Rudd once again brings likable comic charm, Michael Douglas was good, so was Evanegline Lilly and Michelle Pfieffer. Sometimes Kathryn Newton was annoying , but other times she was good. The effects are awesome, I love the star wars like adventure.\"]"
