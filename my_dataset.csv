negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"

Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"
positive,"Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" (PG-13 - 2023 - Theater)
Genre: Fantasy/Comic BookMy Score: 8.1
Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=7 Ending=9 Story=7
Imagine=9 Pace=7 F/X=9 Comic=7 Funny=8After accidentally getting sucked down into the quantum realm, Ant-man and his family learn about a great many things...including their being there was not an accident at all.""It's never too late to stop being a dick."" I wish I would have told my step-father this...but I digress. There's bad and good in here...I guess phase 4 has shattered my expectations because I was actually pleased with about half of this. Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
positive,"We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that."
negative,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
positive,"I loved this movie, I think it's much better than Ant-Man 2. I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews, and I really don't understand the backlash. It was a fun, fast paced adventure with what I will call an ""ensemble"" cast that had the usual fun dialog along the way. Yes, there was a lot of CGI. Yes, there was a transitional cast aspect. No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans. As far as critics' reviews are concerned, I usually find the movies they applaud aren't that good, and movies they dislike are some of my favorites. In short, go see it and make up your own mind. You just might have a great viewing experience."
negative,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
negative,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
negative,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
positive,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
positive,"Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D."
positive,"Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word."
positive,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."

positive,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
negative,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
positive,"Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.
7/10."
positive,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
positive,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
positive,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
positive,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
positive,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
negative,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."
positive,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling. Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on. And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie.The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end. And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics. Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for. It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves. But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes. It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals using high end special effects and it had it's timely and spot on humor. This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
negative,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."
negative,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"
positive,"Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" (PG-13 - 2023 - Theater)
Genre: Fantasy/Comic BookMy Score: 8.1
Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=7 Ending=9 Story=7
Imagine=9 Pace=7 F/X=9 Comic=7 Funny=8After accidentally getting sucked down into the quantum realm, Ant-man and his family learn about a great many things...including their being there was not an accident at all.""It's never too late to stop being a dick."" I wish I would have told my step-father this...but I digress. There's bad and good in here...I guess phase 4 has shattered my expectations because I was actually pleased with about half of this. Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
positive,"We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that."
negative,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
positive,"I loved this movie, I think it's much better than Ant-Man 2. I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews, and I really don't understand the backlash. It was a fun, fast paced adventure with what I will call an ""ensemble"" cast that had the usual fun dialog along the way. Yes, there was a lot of CGI. Yes, there was a transitional cast aspect. No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans. As far as critics' reviews are concerned, I usually find the movies they applaud aren't that good, and movies they dislike are some of my favorites. In short, go see it and make up your own mind. You just might have a great viewing experience."
negative,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
negative,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
negative,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
positive,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
positive,"Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D."
positive,"Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word."
positive,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."

positive,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
negative,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
positive,"Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.
7/10."
positive,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
positive,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
positive,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
positive,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
positive,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
negative,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."
positive,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling. Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on. And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie.The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end. And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics. Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for. It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves. But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes. It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals using high end special effects and it had it's timely and spot on humor. This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
negative,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."
negative,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
negative,"""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
positive,"We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10."
positive,"I feel as if Kevin Feige likes to play connect four with characters in this universe. ""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no."
positive,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin."
positive,"Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!"
negative,"The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors."
positive,"I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story."
negative,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
negative,"Another serving of bland, bombastic superhero sludge from the mcu mcmovie factory. More annoying middle-aged hollywood vacuum tubes flying around on wires in gimpy clown suits. More obnoxious tweeny super geniuses snarking, pouting and virtue signaling their way through 2 hours of nonsense while all the ""adults"" stand around lavishing them with worship and praise. More bright n' shiny cgi strobing to distract the drooling screengazers from the total absence of a coherent plot or a single believable, compelling character. It's all just a big amorphous slurry of multiverses, timeloops and contrivances at this point. After 2 hours of the blathering dingbat Paul Rudd, his spoiled, mindwashed brat, and all the aneurism inducing cgi baffoonery - I'm done."
positive,"This is a great introduction to what Kang could really do for the future of the MCU. The movie starts off a bit slow with some jokes that feel forced. However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past. There were scenes that would leave you ""wow"" but also ones that are uneccesary.Overall the plot of the movie was just alright. This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU."
positive,"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure."
positive,"The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants."
negative,"This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme."
positive,"***Ant Man & the Wasp : Quantumania Movie Review ****Visually Splendid Experience... 🔥🔥🔥Scott Lang is back... This time he is on a mission to save his family from Kang: The Conqueror.Quantumania, Timeline, Kang Variants , Probability Storm & many more terminologies insights got from this movie...VFX i would personally view as Top Notch 🔥🔥Kang alias Jonathon Majors was outstanding. His small version was observed in Loki Season 1 but here he nailed the performance which i feel personally overshadowed the performance of Scott Lang & his team.2 Post credit scenes as always gives hopes to watch it's future Marvel Movies.Overall a visual treat experience movie which no doubt cannot afford to watch on a streaming platform."
positive,"This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating."
negative,Remember everything you loved about Ant man 1?Remember the heart pumping heist theme and the fun score that left you feeling pumped up and excited?Remember the trio of hillarious friends that Scott lang had and their antics?Remember the adorable chemistry between Scott and his daughter?Remember the menacing villain who made you feel uncomfortable and tense not knowing what was going to happen next?Remember when Marvel was a good franchise?Nah. Me neither.This movie has none of the stuff that made me like the first one (and even the second one to some extent)But what it does have is CGI.LOADS of it.What it does have is lots of yelling and screaming and shrinking and growing and bla bla bla boring empty spectacle.There's no heart here. No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis. Ittl take about 30 seconds and you'll have most of the details covered.
positive,"This MCU film is totally overhated without a reason... Firstly,the CGI were from another planet,the visuals were amazing...Also all the cast was great especially Jonathan Majors in the role of Kang the conqueror...He was terrifying.... He played Kang very well and in my opinion is better than Thanos...I am looking forward to see him in Loki season 2.... Furthermore the soundtrack was great and it fits perfectly to the epic final battle... Finally the two post credit scenes were awesome especially the first one with the council of Kangs.... Phase 5 MCU has began with the best way and is going to be peak...Be prepared for Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3."
positive,"A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!"
negative,"Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+."
positive,"'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending."
positive,"Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
positive,"The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather? Is Avatar the only franchise allowed to barf cgi at us with a mediocre script? Come on...Majors was great, the script was passable, and I laughed a ton. It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2. Curious to see how the timeline develops!"
positive,"""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project."
positive,"This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army."
negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"

Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
positive,"We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that."
negative,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
positive,"I loved this movie, I think it's much better than Ant-Man 2. I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews, and I really don't understand the backlash. It was a fun, fast paced adventure with what I will call an ""ensemble"" cast that had the usual fun dialog along the way. Yes, there was a lot of CGI. Yes, there was a transitional cast aspect. No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans. As far as critics' reviews are concerned, I usually find the movies they applaud aren't that good, and movies they dislike are some of my favorites. In short, go see it and make up your own mind. You just might have a great viewing experience."
negative,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
negative,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
negative,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
positive,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
positive,"Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D."
positive,"Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word."
positive,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."

positive,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
negative,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
positive,"Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.
7/10."
positive,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
positive,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
positive,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
positive,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
positive,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
negative,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."
positive,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling. Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on. And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie.The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end. And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics. Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for. It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves. But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes. It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals using high end special effects and it had it's timely and spot on humor. This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
negative,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."
negative,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
negative,"""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
positive,"We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10."
positive,"I feel as if Kevin Feige likes to play connect four with characters in this universe. ""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no."
positive,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin."
positive,"Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!"
negative,"The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors."
positive,"I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story."
negative,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
negative,"Another serving of bland, bombastic superhero sludge from the mcu mcmovie factory. More annoying middle-aged hollywood vacuum tubes flying around on wires in gimpy clown suits. More obnoxious tweeny super geniuses snarking, pouting and virtue signaling their way through 2 hours of nonsense while all the ""adults"" stand around lavishing them with worship and praise. More bright n' shiny cgi strobing to distract the drooling screengazers from the total absence of a coherent plot or a single believable, compelling character. It's all just a big amorphous slurry of multiverses, timeloops and contrivances at this point. After 2 hours of the blathering dingbat Paul Rudd, his spoiled, mindwashed brat, and all the aneurism inducing cgi baffoonery - I'm done."
positive,"This is a great introduction to what Kang could really do for the future of the MCU. The movie starts off a bit slow with some jokes that feel forced. However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past. There were scenes that would leave you ""wow"" but also ones that are uneccesary.Overall the plot of the movie was just alright. This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU."
positive,"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure."
positive,"The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants."
negative,"This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme."
positive,"***Ant Man & the Wasp : Quantumania Movie Review ****Visually Splendid Experience... 🔥🔥🔥Scott Lang is back... This time he is on a mission to save his family from Kang: The Conqueror.Quantumania, Timeline, Kang Variants , Probability Storm & many more terminologies insights got from this movie...VFX i would personally view as Top Notch 🔥🔥Kang alias Jonathon Majors was outstanding. His small version was observed in Loki Season 1 but here he nailed the performance which i feel personally overshadowed the performance of Scott Lang & his team.2 Post credit scenes as always gives hopes to watch it's future Marvel Movies.Overall a visual treat experience movie which no doubt cannot afford to watch on a streaming platform."
positive,"This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating."
negative,Remember everything you loved about Ant man 1?Remember the heart pumping heist theme and the fun score that left you feeling pumped up and excited?Remember the trio of hillarious friends that Scott lang had and their antics?Remember the adorable chemistry between Scott and his daughter?Remember the menacing villain who made you feel uncomfortable and tense not knowing what was going to happen next?Remember when Marvel was a good franchise?Nah. Me neither.This movie has none of the stuff that made me like the first one (and even the second one to some extent)But what it does have is CGI.LOADS of it.What it does have is lots of yelling and screaming and shrinking and growing and bla bla bla boring empty spectacle.There's no heart here. No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis. Ittl take about 30 seconds and you'll have most of the details covered.
positive,"This MCU film is totally overhated without a reason... Firstly,the CGI were from another planet,the visuals were amazing...Also all the cast was great especially Jonathan Majors in the role of Kang the conqueror...He was terrifying.... He played Kang very well and in my opinion is better than Thanos...I am looking forward to see him in Loki season 2.... Furthermore the soundtrack was great and it fits perfectly to the epic final battle... Finally the two post credit scenes were awesome especially the first one with the council of Kangs.... Phase 5 MCU has began with the best way and is going to be peak...Be prepared for Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3."
positive,"A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!"
negative,"Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+."
positive,"'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending."
positive,"Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
positive,"The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather? Is Avatar the only franchise allowed to barf cgi at us with a mediocre script? Come on...Majors was great, the script was passable, and I laughed a ton. It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2. Curious to see how the timeline develops!"
positive,"""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project."
positive,"This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army."
negative,"Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat."
negative,"Positives: Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Paul Rudd are good and familiar. They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them."
positive,"At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2.."
positive,"I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies."
negative,"I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that."
positive,"I really enjoyed the first two movies, plot for the 3rd I really liked having visited the quantum realm besides Hope & Scott's Daughter Casey makes sense for it be be played out there.I loved the idea that the quantum realm has its eco system and it's own people and strange beings but it felt very Guardians of the galaxy but saying that set pieces were good and everyone putting in a good performance but Kang The Conqueror is meant to be the new big bad?Sadly not convinced, more of a pussy cat and very hard having seen how destructible Thanos was, was hoping for more!Other than that, enjoyed at most just not brilliant!"
positive,"This has been a usual marvel movie with all the commercial elements, a simple story with all techs and depth in that. The whole ant family has performed very well. It has fights talks etc. The usual ant man movie things with some humour to be kudos. It could have been different a bit but the movie has been reall usual nothing new. The one thing was kang , oh boy he is just master of conquerer. But such a strong villain been killed in a snap. But i hope something more to come in the future. Kang will return with bang. I am supporting a antogonist for the first time. Paul actually he is been a side stay, kang and janet being the main role played . But he just did justice to the role. It was entirely dominated by kang. As always a happy end to the movie. The main attraction in the post credit never miss it to watch it. Its really mindblowing, i dont want to spoil it. Please do watch it in theaters. A good start to phase 5."
positive,"First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential."
positive,"This was an enjoyable ride. There were glimpses, glimpses of that old Marvel magic at times, the humour, and a decent bad guy actually well used. But honestly Paul Rudd carries this film. He's the only actor who really shines, and eats up every scene he's in. The daughter and Kang are decent too.But it's good to watch a Marvel film without really any SJW nonsense. The focus on story and some jokes might be pushing Marvel back in the right direction (can only hope).The setting was unique and diffferent, but after a while it grated with the overuse of SciFi CGI. It's given me enough to want to see more Kang and maybe theres still life in the old Marvel yet."
positive,"People are acting like this movie is the latest Thor, it's not. It does have some silly moments. But there are plenty of intense moments as well. I went to go see this movie this afternoon and I finally felt like the MCU has hit its stride again. I feel like it's been awhile. I have not been a fan of the new marvel shows, I've honestly felt like they've been pretty lost. This is the first movie that has felt like the MCU is heading towards something, although it may not be the extract thing people guess. All I will say is that people need to give this movie a chance. I'm not a fanboy or a boy, I feel like a lot of the votes are from bots. It's a good movie and deserves a chance."
positive,Well all I can say is well And I thought that this film was very extraordinary And visually awesome however I am not the biggest Is aut_man fan But I am a massive Marvel fand I can tell you that this is my favorite Ant-Man In the trilogy even though The movie starts out a little bit slow but It gets better once all the characters go the Quantum realm and especially towards the end When You don't know if The villain of the film is dead or not I certainly think that if you Are a fan of This superhero Or Marvel Or big action Adventure films then this one is a good 1 to see I absolutely hope they make a 4 Is film And And can't wait to see what happens next I also Can't wait to watch the new Season of Loki.
negative,"This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!"
positive,"Best MCU movie since ""Spider-Mn: No Way Home!"" SO good and not to be missed. I cannot wait to see this movie again. Totally stands on its own, but is going to be the next chapter. SOOOOO good! The world-building is some of the best I've seen, very believable. So often, when movie create a totally new world, it is silly and doesn't make sense. Not in this case. And the inhabitants are far more than just actors in corny makeup. This is SO much better than Thor: Love and Thunder. Wonderful fleshing out of characters! Kang was amazing, acted wonderfully! I look forward to where the MCU goes next!!"
negative,"Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either."
negative,"I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor."
positive,"Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus."
positive,"It hasn't been a great last few outing for MARVEL and combined with the streaming shows, the Phase 4 didn't really hit the mark. With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best."
positive,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumanis is a good film and a good start to the MCU's Phase 5. Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10."
positive,"As another reviewer here has pointed out, this movie failed to introduce kang in its runtime and loki did it better in its finale. Kang the conqueror , is supposed to be an iconic villain and given the fact that he is played by majors , his story must be over the top. Kang has this power to freeze time and he uses that laser energy sorta thing . This guy freaki'n shattered timelines . There is no way scott will win. I want to see conqueror in action. This guy is the next villian of phase five and I cannot wait to look forward to it. Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies . But this movie proved I was wrong. Iam a marvel fanboy but even I am tired of this. It is obvious that marvel is hyping its audience for a future that will not come. GOTG 3 and loki season 2 are my only hope."
positive,"I was worried after hearing about initial mixed reviews and Quantumania being the second lowest scoring MCU film, but the critics were wrong - dead wrong. Quantumania is MCU's ode to Star Wars fun and it really works. The Ant-Man style of comedy is still there even though the stakes are much higher with the arrival of Kang the Conqueror who Jonathan Majors masterfully made the quintessence of intimidation and menace. Marvel made the best choice casting him as the next saga's big bad because his range, expression, and delivery are nonpareil. This guy is raw acting talent.A lot could have gone wrong with Quantumania. Like most of Phase 4, it could have gone too far and still have felt all for nothing. But it was the right amount of lunacy and imagination. The only stretch is MODOK. Yeah, everyone will no doubt agree the movie could've done without him and that he's undeniably the worst thing about the movie. Every scene he's in is so distracting and cringey. Only his last few ""brother"" and ""Avenger"" lines were tolerable - really funny actually. And while the script definitely suffered from spots of juvenile jests that I don't think even kids would find funny, all in all it still did a good job concisely giving backstories and delivering heart-felt moments between Scott and Cassie - the core characters of the story.Paul Rudd still rocks as Ant-Man. His comedic chops and timing always make him so entertaining to watch. Marvel can stop with his solo movies and throw him into every other film for buddy-com action and improve every movie. It would never get old.And I'll just say for the woke-watchers...there's no agenda of any sort in this movie. The swearing is even dialed back a lot especially compared to the last few MCU films. It's definitely more family entertainment."
positive,It wasn't as bad as people said. It was a decent film. Still Thor Love and Thunder is still goatedThis review was made on March 6 23About: The Ant family gets shrunk into the quantum realm. Jane has secrets. The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development. Everyone else was either just there or annoying/looked weird man . *cough* Cassie.When she said the D word to Modok it was so cringe funny.Overall the production and story went well. Way better than reviews stated.Highlight: I liked the possibility scene. Very creative.Quaz was good too. His queen reminded me of Rita. I liked her too. Kang too was iCONIC. Skrull Kang.Goofs: Cassie looked weird. I'm not sure why it was called Antman and Wasp. Wasp was very minor. She had no story.What can be learned? Secrets and Time are a dynamic duo.Should you watch this?: I say yes. Ignore the reviews and box office. Avatar 2 and 1 made a billion but those moves were not good. Antman 3 sets up a couple new events.
negative,"This is the worse written most nonsensical marvel movie, what a waste of 300 million, Paul Rudd seems like an extra in his own movie, Kang is easily defeated, dumb comedic tone, the quantum universe is poorly designed, the daughter is more powerful than modor, first time she uses the suit and she's a master, almost single handedly defeats Kang gimme a friking break, the way they handle the whole movie is a clear sign that the whole marvel universe is tired and should retire, they handle the whole quantum verse however is convenient to their badly written plot, just doesn't make sense at all, it's not even entertaining, cgi looks 20 years old, no emotion no climax no nothing, marvel you're done go home."
positive,"Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Quantamania is a typical marvel movie with grand visuals and a story that has pretty much nothing to offer.Katheryn Newtown seems like a good choice for Cassie lang. Let's hope she has more to offer in the future.As for the story,it gives us the first look at much anticipated Kang the Conqueror and Jonathan Majors has done a phenomenal job in potraying the big bad. But after all those build-ups and hype surrounding Kang as the big bad for this saga, i kinda felt they downplayed him in the movie. For someone as powerful as Kang to go down like that seemed like an injustice to the character.Overall, quantamania is a fun watch but is forgettable once you walk out the theatres. Jonathan Majors is the stand out of the film and am excited for what he holds in the future."
negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"
positive,"Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" (PG-13 - 2023 - Theater)
Genre: Fantasy/Comic BookMy Score: 8.1
Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=7 Ending=9 Story=7
Imagine=9 Pace=7 F/X=9 Comic=7 Funny=8After accidentally getting sucked down into the quantum realm, Ant-man and his family learn about a great many things...including their being there was not an accident at all.""It's never too late to stop being a dick."" I wish I would have told my step-father this...but I digress. There's bad and good in here...I guess phase 4 has shattered my expectations because I was actually pleased with about half of this. Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
positive,"We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that."
negative,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
positive,"I loved this movie, I think it's much better than Ant-Man 2. I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews, and I really don't understand the backlash. It was a fun, fast paced adventure with what I will call an ""ensemble"" cast that had the usual fun dialog along the way. Yes, there was a lot of CGI. Yes, there was a transitional cast aspect. No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans. As far as critics' reviews are concerned, I usually find the movies they applaud aren't that good, and movies they dislike are some of my favorites. In short, go see it and make up your own mind. You just might have a great viewing experience."
negative,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
negative,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
negative,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
positive,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
positive,"Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D."
positive,"Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word."
positive,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."

positive,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
negative,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
positive,"Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.
7/10."
positive,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
positive,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
positive,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
positive,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
positive,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
negative,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."
positive,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling. Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on. And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie.The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end. And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics. Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for. It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves. But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes. It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals using high end special effects and it had it's timely and spot on humor. This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
negative,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."
negative,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
negative,"""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
positive,"We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10."
positive,"I feel as if Kevin Feige likes to play connect four with characters in this universe. ""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no."
positive,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin."
positive,"Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!"
negative,"The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors."
positive,"I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story."
negative,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
negative,"Another serving of bland, bombastic superhero sludge from the mcu mcmovie factory. More annoying middle-aged hollywood vacuum tubes flying around on wires in gimpy clown suits. More obnoxious tweeny super geniuses snarking, pouting and virtue signaling their way through 2 hours of nonsense while all the ""adults"" stand around lavishing them with worship and praise. More bright n' shiny cgi strobing to distract the drooling screengazers from the total absence of a coherent plot or a single believable, compelling character. It's all just a big amorphous slurry of multiverses, timeloops and contrivances at this point. After 2 hours of the blathering dingbat Paul Rudd, his spoiled, mindwashed brat, and all the aneurism inducing cgi baffoonery - I'm done."
positive,"This is a great introduction to what Kang could really do for the future of the MCU. The movie starts off a bit slow with some jokes that feel forced. However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past. There were scenes that would leave you ""wow"" but also ones that are uneccesary.Overall the plot of the movie was just alright. This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU."
positive,"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure."
positive,"The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants."
negative,"This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme."
positive,"***Ant Man & the Wasp : Quantumania Movie Review ****Visually Splendid Experience... 🔥🔥🔥Scott Lang is back... This time he is on a mission to save his family from Kang: The Conqueror.Quantumania, Timeline, Kang Variants , Probability Storm & many more terminologies insights got from this movie...VFX i would personally view as Top Notch 🔥🔥Kang alias Jonathon Majors was outstanding. His small version was observed in Loki Season 1 but here he nailed the performance which i feel personally overshadowed the performance of Scott Lang & his team.2 Post credit scenes as always gives hopes to watch it's future Marvel Movies.Overall a visual treat experience movie which no doubt cannot afford to watch on a streaming platform."
positive,"This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating."
negative,Remember everything you loved about Ant man 1?Remember the heart pumping heist theme and the fun score that left you feeling pumped up and excited?Remember the trio of hillarious friends that Scott lang had and their antics?Remember the adorable chemistry between Scott and his daughter?Remember the menacing villain who made you feel uncomfortable and tense not knowing what was going to happen next?Remember when Marvel was a good franchise?Nah. Me neither.This movie has none of the stuff that made me like the first one (and even the second one to some extent)But what it does have is CGI.LOADS of it.What it does have is lots of yelling and screaming and shrinking and growing and bla bla bla boring empty spectacle.There's no heart here. No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis. Ittl take about 30 seconds and you'll have most of the details covered.
positive,"This MCU film is totally overhated without a reason... Firstly,the CGI were from another planet,the visuals were amazing...Also all the cast was great especially Jonathan Majors in the role of Kang the conqueror...He was terrifying.... He played Kang very well and in my opinion is better than Thanos...I am looking forward to see him in Loki season 2.... Furthermore the soundtrack was great and it fits perfectly to the epic final battle... Finally the two post credit scenes were awesome especially the first one with the council of Kangs.... Phase 5 MCU has began with the best way and is going to be peak...Be prepared for Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3."
positive,"A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!"
negative,"Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+."
positive,"'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending."
positive,"Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
positive,"The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather? Is Avatar the only franchise allowed to barf cgi at us with a mediocre script? Come on...Majors was great, the script was passable, and I laughed a ton. It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2. Curious to see how the timeline develops!"
positive,"""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project."
positive,"This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army."
negative,"Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat."
negative,"Positives: Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Paul Rudd are good and familiar. They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them."
positive,"At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2.."
positive,"I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies."
negative,"I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that."
positive,"I really enjoyed the first two movies, plot for the 3rd I really liked having visited the quantum realm besides Hope & Scott's Daughter Casey makes sense for it be be played out there.I loved the idea that the quantum realm has its eco system and it's own people and strange beings but it felt very Guardians of the galaxy but saying that set pieces were good and everyone putting in a good performance but Kang The Conqueror is meant to be the new big bad?Sadly not convinced, more of a pussy cat and very hard having seen how destructible Thanos was, was hoping for more!Other than that, enjoyed at most just not brilliant!"
positive,"This has been a usual marvel movie with all the commercial elements, a simple story with all techs and depth in that. The whole ant family has performed very well. It has fights talks etc. The usual ant man movie things with some humour to be kudos. It could have been different a bit but the movie has been reall usual nothing new. The one thing was kang , oh boy he is just master of conquerer. But such a strong villain been killed in a snap. But i hope something more to come in the future. Kang will return with bang. I am supporting a antogonist for the first time. Paul actually he is been a side stay, kang and janet being the main role played . But he just did justice to the role. It was entirely dominated by kang. As always a happy end to the movie. The main attraction in the post credit never miss it to watch it. Its really mindblowing, i dont want to spoil it. Please do watch it in theaters. A good start to phase 5."
positive,"First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential."
positive,"This was an enjoyable ride. There were glimpses, glimpses of that old Marvel magic at times, the humour, and a decent bad guy actually well used. But honestly Paul Rudd carries this film. He's the only actor who really shines, and eats up every scene he's in. The daughter and Kang are decent too.But it's good to watch a Marvel film without really any SJW nonsense. The focus on story and some jokes might be pushing Marvel back in the right direction (can only hope).The setting was unique and diffferent, but after a while it grated with the overuse of SciFi CGI. It's given me enough to want to see more Kang and maybe theres still life in the old Marvel yet."
positive,"People are acting like this movie is the latest Thor, it's not. It does have some silly moments. But there are plenty of intense moments as well. I went to go see this movie this afternoon and I finally felt like the MCU has hit its stride again. I feel like it's been awhile. I have not been a fan of the new marvel shows, I've honestly felt like they've been pretty lost. This is the first movie that has felt like the MCU is heading towards something, although it may not be the extract thing people guess. All I will say is that people need to give this movie a chance. I'm not a fanboy or a boy, I feel like a lot of the votes are from bots. It's a good movie and deserves a chance."
positive,Well all I can say is well And I thought that this film was very extraordinary And visually awesome however I am not the biggest Is aut_man fan But I am a massive Marvel fand I can tell you that this is my favorite Ant-Man In the trilogy even though The movie starts out a little bit slow but It gets better once all the characters go the Quantum realm and especially towards the end When You don't know if The villain of the film is dead or not I certainly think that if you Are a fan of This superhero Or Marvel Or big action Adventure films then this one is a good 1 to see I absolutely hope they make a 4 Is film And And can't wait to see what happens next I also Can't wait to watch the new Season of Loki.
negative,"This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!"
positive,"Best MCU movie since ""Spider-Mn: No Way Home!"" SO good and not to be missed. I cannot wait to see this movie again. Totally stands on its own, but is going to be the next chapter. SOOOOO good! The world-building is some of the best I've seen, very believable. So often, when movie create a totally new world, it is silly and doesn't make sense. Not in this case. And the inhabitants are far more than just actors in corny makeup. This is SO much better than Thor: Love and Thunder. Wonderful fleshing out of characters! Kang was amazing, acted wonderfully! I look forward to where the MCU goes next!!"
negative,"Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either."
negative,"I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor."
positive,"Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus."
positive,"It hasn't been a great last few outing for MARVEL and combined with the streaming shows, the Phase 4 didn't really hit the mark. With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best."
positive,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumanis is a good film and a good start to the MCU's Phase 5. Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10."
positive,"As another reviewer here has pointed out, this movie failed to introduce kang in its runtime and loki did it better in its finale. Kang the conqueror , is supposed to be an iconic villain and given the fact that he is played by majors , his story must be over the top. Kang has this power to freeze time and he uses that laser energy sorta thing . This guy freaki'n shattered timelines . There is no way scott will win. I want to see conqueror in action. This guy is the next villian of phase five and I cannot wait to look forward to it. Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies . But this movie proved I was wrong. Iam a marvel fanboy but even I am tired of this. It is obvious that marvel is hyping its audience for a future that will not come. GOTG 3 and loki season 2 are my only hope."
positive,"I was worried after hearing about initial mixed reviews and Quantumania being the second lowest scoring MCU film, but the critics were wrong - dead wrong. Quantumania is MCU's ode to Star Wars fun and it really works. The Ant-Man style of comedy is still there even though the stakes are much higher with the arrival of Kang the Conqueror who Jonathan Majors masterfully made the quintessence of intimidation and menace. Marvel made the best choice casting him as the next saga's big bad because his range, expression, and delivery are nonpareil. This guy is raw acting talent.A lot could have gone wrong with Quantumania. Like most of Phase 4, it could have gone too far and still have felt all for nothing. But it was the right amount of lunacy and imagination. The only stretch is MODOK. Yeah, everyone will no doubt agree the movie could've done without him and that he's undeniably the worst thing about the movie. Every scene he's in is so distracting and cringey. Only his last few ""brother"" and ""Avenger"" lines were tolerable - really funny actually. And while the script definitely suffered from spots of juvenile jests that I don't think even kids would find funny, all in all it still did a good job concisely giving backstories and delivering heart-felt moments between Scott and Cassie - the core characters of the story.Paul Rudd still rocks as Ant-Man. His comedic chops and timing always make him so entertaining to watch. Marvel can stop with his solo movies and throw him into every other film for buddy-com action and improve every movie. It would never get old.And I'll just say for the woke-watchers...there's no agenda of any sort in this movie. The swearing is even dialed back a lot especially compared to the last few MCU films. It's definitely more family entertainment."
positive,It wasn't as bad as people said. It was a decent film. Still Thor Love and Thunder is still goatedThis review was made on March 6 23About: The Ant family gets shrunk into the quantum realm. Jane has secrets. The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development. Everyone else was either just there or annoying/looked weird man . *cough* Cassie.When she said the D word to Modok it was so cringe funny.Overall the production and story went well. Way better than reviews stated.Highlight: I liked the possibility scene. Very creative.Quaz was good too. His queen reminded me of Rita. I liked her too. Kang too was iCONIC. Skrull Kang.Goofs: Cassie looked weird. I'm not sure why it was called Antman and Wasp. Wasp was very minor. She had no story.What can be learned? Secrets and Time are a dynamic duo.Should you watch this?: I say yes. Ignore the reviews and box office. Avatar 2 and 1 made a billion but those moves were not good. Antman 3 sets up a couple new events.
negative,"This is the worse written most nonsensical marvel movie, what a waste of 300 million, Paul Rudd seems like an extra in his own movie, Kang is easily defeated, dumb comedic tone, the quantum universe is poorly designed, the daughter is more powerful than modor, first time she uses the suit and she's a master, almost single handedly defeats Kang gimme a friking break, the way they handle the whole movie is a clear sign that the whole marvel universe is tired and should retire, they handle the whole quantum verse however is convenient to their badly written plot, just doesn't make sense at all, it's not even entertaining, cgi looks 20 years old, no emotion no climax no nothing, marvel you're done go home."
positive,"Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Quantamania is a typical marvel movie with grand visuals and a story that has pretty much nothing to offer.Katheryn Newtown seems like a good choice for Cassie lang. Let's hope she has more to offer in the future.As for the story,it gives us the first look at much anticipated Kang the Conqueror and Jonathan Majors has done a phenomenal job in potraying the big bad. But after all those build-ups and hype surrounding Kang as the big bad for this saga, i kinda felt they downplayed him in the movie. For someone as powerful as Kang to go down like that seemed like an injustice to the character.Overall, quantamania is a fun watch but is forgettable once you walk out the theatres. Jonathan Majors is the stand out of the film and am excited for what he holds in the future."
negative,"Trash beyond anything I could ever imagine. They should give refunds to everyone who went to see this garbage.The most unlikable characters the MCU has ever produced. The movie only has two types of characters: annoying girl-boss and annoying pathetic loser. These characters aren't relatable because these are the type of people you run away from on the street.Let's dump 300million into the CGI vomit machine and hope no one realizes how terrible the movie is. This is the grand strategy behind the geniuses at Marvel. It's sad and pathetic.I'm giving this a 1/10 because it has no value, and I left the theater in a worse state than I went in."
negative,"There's not much to say about the movie, to be honest. Every year, we've been watching a lot of average Marvel movies, series, and mini-series.The worst thing about this film was that it had a lot of problems showing Kang's power, especially in the scene where Ant-Man and Wasp fought him in the last scene, the cheesiness annoyed me.The acting, script, directorial skill, even the progress and handling of the revolutionary theme in the final scene, everything was very normal and ordinary. We've seen too many similar things in many works.The part I liked was the good visualization of the quantum dimension, which was very Star Wars themed. Especially the first scene with quantum was great in the cinema. Also, the adaptation of MODOK character to the cinematic universe was good, but his dialogues and death made me extremely sad because they were bad.In short, there was nothing extra in the movie, it was watchable but the forced joke attempts and poorly executed villain characters ruined the movie. Marvel needs to be more careful now, and realize that spending a lot of money doesn't make a good movie. I think the writers, especially in Phase 4, need to accept the fact that they are doing a bad job and choose a different path. Finally, I should add that the mid-credit scene was really bad, the voice changing was cringe-worthy. It's an average movie that can be watched."
positive,"Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichés, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution."
negative,"Take Marvels recent lacklustre offerings, add some Avatar visuals and the dialogue and acting of the last few Star Wars films, and you have this. It's cheesy, in the extreme. It's chock full of the usual tropes and character motivators that plague Marvel films. It feels like we are being force fed the same story, over and over, in all their films. Most of the characters are unlikeable, shallow and forgettable. I stopped caring about any of them about 20, yawn inducing, minutes in. This is not good film making. Loud colours, over the top character dynamics and a weak plot, do not give you a good film. I felt like I was watching garishly dressed, looking for laughs and attention, annoyances. Clowns, in other words. I felt like I was watching clowns. And that makes me so sad."
positive,"Quantimania is a strange a little movie. It tries to be an adventure movie, an Ant-Man movie and almost an avenger movie of sorts. There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang."
positive,"7 is well-deserved but wanted to give 8 just because I think 6.6 is not enough.Very good movie. No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful."
negative,"Scott Skywalker, Princess Hope, Obi-Wan Hank and Cassie-Rey face off against the villainous Darth Kang who has created a Multi-Verse Killer.Kang is being protected by Quantum Realm Troopers who guard his sky city against a group of resistance fighters looking to take back their planet.Overall a pretty good film. Not great, but not bad. It was Marvel without being overtly Marvel. Very thin, somewhat predictable plot without any surprises or twist. But some great visuals, some decent action sequences and a few good laughs.I saw the 3D version which was decent. No distracting gimmicks. Just some good added depth."
negative,"The MCU used to be something I would get excited about. While obviously not artistic masterpieces, the MCU used to be fun popcorn entertainment that would be a good way to take your family to the theater and be entertained by charming characters and fun action sequences. Now, it's a pale shadow of what it used to be and seems to only get butts in seats based on brand recognition alone.Pretty much everything I hated about phase 4 is on full display here. The writing is juvenile, the visual effects are atrocious, the humor is obnoxious, the ""emotional"" scenes don't work and all of the characters are hollow and uninteresting. Although I did enjoy the post credits scene and a couple of moments scattered throughout the film, I was begging for this one to just end as it is 2 hours long yet it felt like 4 hours.I'm so sick and tired of this franchise that I really want it to die. After Guardians 3, I might be tapping out completely."
positive,"This movie was not as bad as everyone is claiming. Is it of the same caliber as Lord of the Rings.... No. However, based on them having to make a movie about Antman and the Wasp, while at the same time having to set up the next phase of Marvel, I thought they did a great job. It was a fun movie and the visuals I thought were great.I thought the acting was great and the story moved along well. It was the first movie I've seen with Jonathan Majors and I thought he did an amazing job and I'm excited to check out some of his other acting credits.I went in to this with lower expectations because I haven't been wild about the new content from the MCU but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.I know some people were upset with how MODOK was portrayed but I thought they did a great job making him a fun addition. There is no way to make MODOK in a live action movie serious. So making him the butt of a joke was a great way to add him.I recommend giving this movie a shot."
positive,"The movie sets up the future of MCU but as an individual story it's not that great. The storyline is too obvious and no elements of suprise & twist. From acting point of view the movie looses its string on emotional pov, especially the father - daughter chemistry of Scott & Cassy. Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.Overall an one time watch. The movie has 2 post credit scenes and both are important for future."
negative,"MCU is dead. It is official. They can't produce any good movie anymore. It would be a safe bet to not watch their upcoming movies as they will involve this lethargic concept of multi-verse. How much of the same thing with the only difference of theme can people keep watching?About this movie, the story is meh, full of cliches, and the plot is quite predictable. It is nothing like the first ant-man movie.Animations are overdone, very flashy sometimes and not good for weak eyes. They aren't beautiful either.Only save here is the acting by senior actors.Verdict: save your money and time. Don't watch."
positive,"So this is rated about the same as Thor love and thunder? Really? Love and thunder was a bad film, this really isn't in the same league! I really enjoyed it, took it for what it was, some entertainment in a make believe world. Wasn't disappointed.Yes Marvel are churning out films like kids for child support.. doesn't mean they are all bad.. this seems to be the popular notion and go to criticism. Looking forward to seeing where the new story arc goes, hope they don't pull a love and thunder with the next Guardians film!In short, watch it, don't take it seriously and just enjoy it.. you won't be disappointed."
positive,"The movie is what it is; just for fun. Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun."
positive,"As a kid, I read and re-read Marvel Premiere #47, which showed how Scott Lang became Ant-Man. Written by David Michelinie and drawn by X-Men team of teams John Byrne and Terry Austin, it was a story I read and re-read and if you have ever seen the way I draw comic books, so much of it comes from this issue.So when it comes to that whole ""Are comics cinema?"" back and forth argument, I think you can figure out what side I'm on. Are there too many comic book movies? Were there too many giallo from 1970-1975? Did Italy make too many Westerns? Were there too many slashers in 1981? Can there be too much of something that you love?Alright, now that I have gotten past the legally required nod to serious criticism, let me tell you why I enjoyed this movie about humanoid broccoli.After the Avengers save everything from Thanos, former criminal and current Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled down from being Ant-Man, instead enjoying life as a writer, husband of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and father of Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), who is upset that her father isn't fighting for people any longer, instead enjoying the fruits of his hard work and resting on his laurels. There's a moment that's interesting here, as she discusses all the people who were displaced in the time where Thanos killed half of reality and now are homeless. Yes, it'd be great to explore this but this is a popcorn movie that soon moves past that; I'm not suggesting a popcorn movie delve into that, but hey, if there ends up being a Disney+ D-Man series that does, I'd watch that. Also, the fact that I just casually namedropped D-Man should explain why I never went to the prom.Anyways, Cassie has been working with her stepmother Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to communicate with the Quantum Realm, the place where Hank's wife Janey Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years of her life and has no interest in going back, particularly when it comes to explaining her past or unleashing new Marvel Cinematic Universe big bad Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, who is quite frankly amazing in this movie and brings a real sense of big drama to his role, not to mention all the various - oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING, I forgot that legal disclaimer -versions of Kang that he shows off, including Immortus, Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion and Victor Timely).Everyone soon gets pulled into that Quantum Realm and becomes part of the war between its inhabitants, with good rebels Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, who was already part of the MCU as Kimball in Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., as well as Major Sarah Grey in the DC superhero TV series Black Lightning and a comms officer on The Mandalorian; if you really want me to go full geek, she's a member of former Micronauts leader Commander Arcturus Rann's Enigma Force alongside other non-Mego owned characters Marionette and Bug; one more semicolon but man, this movie is as close as we're ever getting to a Michael Golden-era Micronauts movie), telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper; he's not Quasar, as many Marvel fans thought, but when he does pull a password out of someone's mind at one point, it's 18147, which would be Avengers #181, Scott Lang's first appearance, and a shout out to the aforementioned Marvel Premiere #47), the slime creature with no holes named Veb (David Dastmalchian, who was Kurt in the last two Ant-Man movies, Abra Kadabra on The Flash and Polka Dot Man in Suicide Squad), the flashlight head Xolum (James Cutler) and oh yeah, there's Bill Murray as Lando Calrissian (I kid, he's Lord Krylar, another of the characters like Jentorra who come from K'ai, the microplanet where the Hulk met one of the loves of his life Jarella) battling Kang and his Tron: Legacy-looking soldiers like he's Baron Karza or something.Anyways, yes, this all feels rather like Star Wars but then again isn't Star Wars influenced if not ripped off from Jack Kirby's Fourth World? Kirby invented most of the MCU and rebelling against a dark authority is pretty much an archetype. Where this gets kind of operatic is that Ant-Man is, well, an ant against space god Kang and that's a battle that I never saw coming.I also never thought I'd see MODOK (Machine Organism Designed Only for Killing) in a movie, much less one that fully embraces the absolutely goofy idea of a giant head in a chair with weapons and baby legs. Also, this ends up being former Yellowjacket Darren Cross from the first movie and every time his real face shows up, it breaks the movie but it's a welcome break in the movie.You can imagine - and you'd be right - that the good guys win but this movie brings up an interesting idea that you can't just punch Kang, who lives his life across multiple timelines that are not linear and that this Kang may not be the worst of the many Kangs. Then Scott brushes it off and tries to enjoy some Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake (the fact that the ice cream chain has no tie-in flavor and yet had a Condorman flavor back in the 80s is kind of upsetting).In the same way that politics - nice socialism shoutout with the ants in this - just leads to people not listening to one another, a lot of folks have their minds made up about comic book movies which are really just mythology and should be seen as such. That said, this movie did what all popcorn films should: it entertained me. I think it's hilarious that one of the film's writers, Jeff Loveness, said that this movie is ""Jodorowsky's Dune within Marvel"" and there are not enough drugs in the world to show you what Alejandro Jodorowsky would do with a Marvel film but hey, he also did The Incal in comics form, so when you denigrate comics, keep in mind that a hero of cinema spent so much of his time there.I explained to my wife tonight that as a kid, there I never really wanted to get involved in human drama or how stressful some extended family members could be, so I just filled my life with comic books. Often when we talk on the phone, my mom will say, ""Do you remember this person,"" and the answer is no, I do not remember this person. However, if she asked, ""Was Wolverine really in World War 2?"" I could give her several anecdotes and explain how Black Widow could be young and yet still saved by Logan and Captain America in 1941.So yeah, I liked this movie."
positive,"Just finished watching the movie at the cinema and it was really awesome. Great fun and a lot of sci fi. Yes, it wasn't a grand plot like end-game. But still very entertaining and packed. Movie was clean and story was good. Plus it ties to the next phase of marvel movies. I assume low reviews are because people were comparing it to some great ones as the story could have been better and perhaps some might think it's a little random. But for those who are not so attached to the perfect marvel story. It's great. I would definitely give it a go. I watched it in 3D and CGI and effects were also pretty good. There are 2 credit scenes. Enjoy :)"
positive,"Aa a solo movie ye ek acchi movie hai...
Acchi comedy+ badiya action seen hai...Kang the conqueror 🔥🤙 like ek baap level villen ki filling deta he ye banda .End fight.... Kang v/s Lang are amazing 😍It is best antman movie in terms of action.This film have two post credit scene

positive,"We go down into the quantum world and enter planet cgi. Apart from the actors everything is CGI. There are strange creatures and landscapes. There are people who for the most part are similar to human, body, 2 arms, 2 legs etc. But with various different heads. There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.The plot is acceptable and the villain is great. He's definitely menacing. They're so confident of him they say he'll be back.So enjoy. Ant-man and the wasp will win but they left a let out for a sequel."
negative,"With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
positive,"This movie was great. The cgi gave me a little bit of a headache but not a migraine or anything. Also this movie is more serious instead of funny. They have jokes in the movie every now and then, but not so much. I don't really like how they handled
M. O. D. O. K. But he was funny and has an exciting return from a previous character. Kang is really scary and disturbing. There is two bonus scenes in total. One of them is a great way to show the future of the multiverse saga and the second one made me jump out of my seat because I was so happy. This film was a great way to open up phase five.8/10."
positive,"Jonathan Majors performance as 'Kang The Conqueror' is praise worthy, he delivers it with great intensity. Kang chaos is kicked off for the 'Multiverse Saga', with this entry movie of MCU Phase 5. Entertainment is filled with humorous comedy and action that MCU delivers as always. Adventure of quantum realm with good screen time is key to this movie, and you will love to see good family drama enhanced. Lower your expectation and enjoy this movie in 3D, I don't understand why is this movie getting such rotten reviews. Wait until last before getting of your seats, those two P. C. S . Is awesome, it won't let you disappoint."
negative,"Where do you start with Quantumania?It's an absolute mess of a movie and the demise of the Marvel Universe speeds up.The biggest threat to the multiverse and beyond isn't Kang or Thanos or Dr. Doom or whoever.It's the writing committees that have pretty much written everything since End Game.It's been downhill since then with a few decent moments in between.Quantumania is terrible. Wait for it to show on Disney if you must. Or, you could do yourself a favour and give it a wide berth. It has none of the charm of the previous two films and absolute zero jeopardy.There is nothing on the line because Kang can jump back and forward through time through multiple personalities. So nothing matters."
positive,"The third movie was totally different than the previous movies. It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang. We get to see a throwback segment and find out more about Kang and Janet's time when she vanished into the quantum level."
negative,"Ant-Man's third installment in the MCU the start of the great phase 5 woohoo!! Bringing in the with bang Kang the next big baddie in MCU after Thanos, or did they??....For some reason even after a very bad 2nd movie I was excited to see this 3rd installment and see how the character of Kang would be portrayed in the movie, but after watching it while the performance of Jonathan majors was standout, I was left underwhelmed. Its just another Marvel movie with a lot of shortcomings in the storyline. The plot felt uninspired just like the previous one without bringing anything new to the table.The Movie in its core the movie lacks proper development even though the movie had some beautiful visual effects they only feel to serve as distraction from the weak plot. Its basically all just CG other than maybe the faces of some at times .If you are also someone who used to love Marvel and was hoping that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania would get the MCU back on track after several disappointing entries and you can safely avoid to go out of your way to watch this. 6 is for real generous for this."
negative,"Negatives: No Michael Peña/Luis (in a freaking Ant Man movie which he's always in), ridiculous scenes and dialogue that seemed to be written by children (I trusted you, you gave your word when he didn't know Kang at all, etc), MODOK and how dumb he was/looked and his character's lines (he did not need to be in the movie), and then playing the pronoun game earlier in the movie way too much and how they kept saying ""him, he"" etc talking about Kang just to build tension which got annoying at a certain point.Positives: Kang was a cool and powerful villain and Jonathan Majors acted very well and I can't wait to see him in Creed 3, Paul Rudd did well as Scott Lang as always and his humor worked, and the world building and effects/green screen looked really good and it was creative what they did with the quantum realm.Overall it wasn't a bad movie, the story was good but it had parts that made me cringe pretty hard. I'd much rather rewatch the first one or second one (which are more original and funnier)."
negative,"I didnt hate this movie since Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas were really good and made it worth the watch. Paul Rudd ruins it IMO and I can hardly stand him and will never understand why they chose him to play a super hero in the first place. I loved the world building in this movie. The wife, Evaneline Lilly? Has no business playing Michelle Pfeiffers daughter, she looked the same age or just a few years younger. Who cast Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother? She looked great IMO and was just awesome. I'm truly tired of these Marvel movies, but since not much else is being made, and I thought this one would be interesting, I went to see it. Its better than nothing, so I gave it 6 stars. The actor playing the bad guy was great too."
negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"
positive,"Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" (PG-13 - 2023 - Theater)
Genre: Fantasy/Comic BookMy Score: 8.1
Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=7 Ending=9 Story=7
Imagine=9 Pace=7 F/X=9 Comic=7 Funny=8After accidentally getting sucked down into the quantum realm, Ant-man and his family learn about a great many things...including their being there was not an accident at all.""It's never too late to stop being a dick."" I wish I would have told my step-father this...but I digress. There's bad and good in here...I guess phase 4 has shattered my expectations because I was actually pleased with about half of this. Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
positive,"We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that."
negative,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
positive,"I loved this movie, I think it's much better than Ant-Man 2. I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews, and I really don't understand the backlash. It was a fun, fast paced adventure with what I will call an ""ensemble"" cast that had the usual fun dialog along the way. Yes, there was a lot of CGI. Yes, there was a transitional cast aspect. No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans. As far as critics' reviews are concerned, I usually find the movies they applaud aren't that good, and movies they dislike are some of my favorites. In short, go see it and make up your own mind. You just might have a great viewing experience."
negative,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
negative,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
negative,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
positive,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
positive,"Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D."
positive,"Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word."
positive,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."

positive,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
negative,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
positive,"Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.
7/10."
positive,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
positive,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
positive,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
positive,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
positive,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
negative,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."
positive,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling. Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on. And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie.The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end. And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics. Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for. It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves. But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes. It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals using high end special effects and it had it's timely and spot on humor. This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
negative,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."
negative,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
negative,"""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
positive,"We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10."
positive,"I feel as if Kevin Feige likes to play connect four with characters in this universe. ""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no."
positive,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin."
positive,"Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!"
negative,"The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors."
positive,"I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story."
negative,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
negative,"Another serving of bland, bombastic superhero sludge from the mcu mcmovie factory. More annoying middle-aged hollywood vacuum tubes flying around on wires in gimpy clown suits. More obnoxious tweeny super geniuses snarking, pouting and virtue signaling their way through 2 hours of nonsense while all the ""adults"" stand around lavishing them with worship and praise. More bright n' shiny cgi strobing to distract the drooling screengazers from the total absence of a coherent plot or a single believable, compelling character. It's all just a big amorphous slurry of multiverses, timeloops and contrivances at this point. After 2 hours of the blathering dingbat Paul Rudd, his spoiled, mindwashed brat, and all the aneurism inducing cgi baffoonery - I'm done."
positive,"This is a great introduction to what Kang could really do for the future of the MCU. The movie starts off a bit slow with some jokes that feel forced. However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past. There were scenes that would leave you ""wow"" but also ones that are uneccesary.Overall the plot of the movie was just alright. This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU."
positive,"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure."
positive,"The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants."
negative,"This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme."
positive,"***Ant Man & the Wasp : Quantumania Movie Review ****Visually Splendid Experience... 🔥🔥🔥Scott Lang is back... This time he is on a mission to save his family from Kang: The Conqueror.Quantumania, Timeline, Kang Variants , Probability Storm & many more terminologies insights got from this movie...VFX i would personally view as Top Notch 🔥🔥Kang alias Jonathon Majors was outstanding. His small version was observed in Loki Season 1 but here he nailed the performance which i feel personally overshadowed the performance of Scott Lang & his team.2 Post credit scenes as always gives hopes to watch it's future Marvel Movies.Overall a visual treat experience movie which no doubt cannot afford to watch on a streaming platform."
positive,"This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating."
negative,Remember everything you loved about Ant man 1?Remember the heart pumping heist theme and the fun score that left you feeling pumped up and excited?Remember the trio of hillarious friends that Scott lang had and their antics?Remember the adorable chemistry between Scott and his daughter?Remember the menacing villain who made you feel uncomfortable and tense not knowing what was going to happen next?Remember when Marvel was a good franchise?Nah. Me neither.This movie has none of the stuff that made me like the first one (and even the second one to some extent)But what it does have is CGI.LOADS of it.What it does have is lots of yelling and screaming and shrinking and growing and bla bla bla boring empty spectacle.There's no heart here. No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis. Ittl take about 30 seconds and you'll have most of the details covered.
positive,"This MCU film is totally overhated without a reason... Firstly,the CGI were from another planet,the visuals were amazing...Also all the cast was great especially Jonathan Majors in the role of Kang the conqueror...He was terrifying.... He played Kang very well and in my opinion is better than Thanos...I am looking forward to see him in Loki season 2.... Furthermore the soundtrack was great and it fits perfectly to the epic final battle... Finally the two post credit scenes were awesome especially the first one with the council of Kangs.... Phase 5 MCU has began with the best way and is going to be peak...Be prepared for Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3."
positive,"A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!"
negative,"Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+."
positive,"'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending."
positive,"Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
positive,"The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather? Is Avatar the only franchise allowed to barf cgi at us with a mediocre script? Come on...Majors was great, the script was passable, and I laughed a ton. It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2. Curious to see how the timeline develops!"
positive,"""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project."
positive,"This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army."
negative,"Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat."
negative,"Positives: Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Paul Rudd are good and familiar. They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them."
positive,"At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2.."
positive,"I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies."
negative,"I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that."
positive,"I really enjoyed the first two movies, plot for the 3rd I really liked having visited the quantum realm besides Hope & Scott's Daughter Casey makes sense for it be be played out there.I loved the idea that the quantum realm has its eco system and it's own people and strange beings but it felt very Guardians of the galaxy but saying that set pieces were good and everyone putting in a good performance but Kang The Conqueror is meant to be the new big bad?Sadly not convinced, more of a pussy cat and very hard having seen how destructible Thanos was, was hoping for more!Other than that, enjoyed at most just not brilliant!"
positive,"This has been a usual marvel movie with all the commercial elements, a simple story with all techs and depth in that. The whole ant family has performed very well. It has fights talks etc. The usual ant man movie things with some humour to be kudos. It could have been different a bit but the movie has been reall usual nothing new. The one thing was kang , oh boy he is just master of conquerer. But such a strong villain been killed in a snap. But i hope something more to come in the future. Kang will return with bang. I am supporting a antogonist for the first time. Paul actually he is been a side stay, kang and janet being the main role played . But he just did justice to the role. It was entirely dominated by kang. As always a happy end to the movie. The main attraction in the post credit never miss it to watch it. Its really mindblowing, i dont want to spoil it. Please do watch it in theaters. A good start to phase 5."
positive,"First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential."
positive,"This was an enjoyable ride. There were glimpses, glimpses of that old Marvel magic at times, the humour, and a decent bad guy actually well used. But honestly Paul Rudd carries this film. He's the only actor who really shines, and eats up every scene he's in. The daughter and Kang are decent too.But it's good to watch a Marvel film without really any SJW nonsense. The focus on story and some jokes might be pushing Marvel back in the right direction (can only hope).The setting was unique and diffferent, but after a while it grated with the overuse of SciFi CGI. It's given me enough to want to see more Kang and maybe theres still life in the old Marvel yet."
positive,"People are acting like this movie is the latest Thor, it's not. It does have some silly moments. But there are plenty of intense moments as well. I went to go see this movie this afternoon and I finally felt like the MCU has hit its stride again. I feel like it's been awhile. I have not been a fan of the new marvel shows, I've honestly felt like they've been pretty lost. This is the first movie that has felt like the MCU is heading towards something, although it may not be the extract thing people guess. All I will say is that people need to give this movie a chance. I'm not a fanboy or a boy, I feel like a lot of the votes are from bots. It's a good movie and deserves a chance."
positive,Well all I can say is well And I thought that this film was very extraordinary And visually awesome however I am not the biggest Is aut_man fan But I am a massive Marvel fand I can tell you that this is my favorite Ant-Man In the trilogy even though The movie starts out a little bit slow but It gets better once all the characters go the Quantum realm and especially towards the end When You don't know if The villain of the film is dead or not I certainly think that if you Are a fan of This superhero Or Marvel Or big action Adventure films then this one is a good 1 to see I absolutely hope they make a 4 Is film And And can't wait to see what happens next I also Can't wait to watch the new Season of Loki.
negative,"This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!"
positive,"Best MCU movie since ""Spider-Mn: No Way Home!"" SO good and not to be missed. I cannot wait to see this movie again. Totally stands on its own, but is going to be the next chapter. SOOOOO good! The world-building is some of the best I've seen, very believable. So often, when movie create a totally new world, it is silly and doesn't make sense. Not in this case. And the inhabitants are far more than just actors in corny makeup. This is SO much better than Thor: Love and Thunder. Wonderful fleshing out of characters! Kang was amazing, acted wonderfully! I look forward to where the MCU goes next!!"
negative,"Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either."
negative,"I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor."
positive,"Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus."
positive,"It hasn't been a great last few outing for MARVEL and combined with the streaming shows, the Phase 4 didn't really hit the mark. With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best."
positive,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumanis is a good film and a good start to the MCU's Phase 5. Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10."
positive,"As another reviewer here has pointed out, this movie failed to introduce kang in its runtime and loki did it better in its finale. Kang the conqueror , is supposed to be an iconic villain and given the fact that he is played by majors , his story must be over the top. Kang has this power to freeze time and he uses that laser energy sorta thing . This guy freaki'n shattered timelines . There is no way scott will win. I want to see conqueror in action. This guy is the next villian of phase five and I cannot wait to look forward to it. Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies . But this movie proved I was wrong. Iam a marvel fanboy but even I am tired of this. It is obvious that marvel is hyping its audience for a future that will not come. GOTG 3 and loki season 2 are my only hope."
positive,"I was worried after hearing about initial mixed reviews and Quantumania being the second lowest scoring MCU film, but the critics were wrong - dead wrong. Quantumania is MCU's ode to Star Wars fun and it really works. The Ant-Man style of comedy is still there even though the stakes are much higher with the arrival of Kang the Conqueror who Jonathan Majors masterfully made the quintessence of intimidation and menace. Marvel made the best choice casting him as the next saga's big bad because his range, expression, and delivery are nonpareil. This guy is raw acting talent.A lot could have gone wrong with Quantumania. Like most of Phase 4, it could have gone too far and still have felt all for nothing. But it was the right amount of lunacy and imagination. The only stretch is MODOK. Yeah, everyone will no doubt agree the movie could've done without him and that he's undeniably the worst thing about the movie. Every scene he's in is so distracting and cringey. Only his last few ""brother"" and ""Avenger"" lines were tolerable - really funny actually. And while the script definitely suffered from spots of juvenile jests that I don't think even kids would find funny, all in all it still did a good job concisely giving backstories and delivering heart-felt moments between Scott and Cassie - the core characters of the story.Paul Rudd still rocks as Ant-Man. His comedic chops and timing always make him so entertaining to watch. Marvel can stop with his solo movies and throw him into every other film for buddy-com action and improve every movie. It would never get old.And I'll just say for the woke-watchers...there's no agenda of any sort in this movie. The swearing is even dialed back a lot especially compared to the last few MCU films. It's definitely more family entertainment."
positive,It wasn't as bad as people said. It was a decent film. Still Thor Love and Thunder is still goatedThis review was made on March 6 23About: The Ant family gets shrunk into the quantum realm. Jane has secrets. The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development. Everyone else was either just there or annoying/looked weird man . *cough* Cassie.When she said the D word to Modok it was so cringe funny.Overall the production and story went well. Way better than reviews stated.Highlight: I liked the possibility scene. Very creative.Quaz was good too. His queen reminded me of Rita. I liked her too. Kang too was iCONIC. Skrull Kang.Goofs: Cassie looked weird. I'm not sure why it was called Antman and Wasp. Wasp was very minor. She had no story.What can be learned? Secrets and Time are a dynamic duo.Should you watch this?: I say yes. Ignore the reviews and box office. Avatar 2 and 1 made a billion but those moves were not good. Antman 3 sets up a couple new events.
negative,"This is the worse written most nonsensical marvel movie, what a waste of 300 million, Paul Rudd seems like an extra in his own movie, Kang is easily defeated, dumb comedic tone, the quantum universe is poorly designed, the daughter is more powerful than modor, first time she uses the suit and she's a master, almost single handedly defeats Kang gimme a friking break, the way they handle the whole movie is a clear sign that the whole marvel universe is tired and should retire, they handle the whole quantum verse however is convenient to their badly written plot, just doesn't make sense at all, it's not even entertaining, cgi looks 20 years old, no emotion no climax no nothing, marvel you're done go home."
positive,"Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Quantamania is a typical marvel movie with grand visuals and a story that has pretty much nothing to offer.Katheryn Newtown seems like a good choice for Cassie lang. Let's hope she has more to offer in the future.As for the story,it gives us the first look at much anticipated Kang the Conqueror and Jonathan Majors has done a phenomenal job in potraying the big bad. But after all those build-ups and hype surrounding Kang as the big bad for this saga, i kinda felt they downplayed him in the movie. For someone as powerful as Kang to go down like that seemed like an injustice to the character.Overall, quantamania is a fun watch but is forgettable once you walk out the theatres. Jonathan Majors is the stand out of the film and am excited for what he holds in the future."
negative,"Trash beyond anything I could ever imagine. They should give refunds to everyone who went to see this garbage.The most unlikable characters the MCU has ever produced. The movie only has two types of characters: annoying girl-boss and annoying pathetic loser. These characters aren't relatable because these are the type of people you run away from on the street.Let's dump 300million into the CGI vomit machine and hope no one realizes how terrible the movie is. This is the grand strategy behind the geniuses at Marvel. It's sad and pathetic.I'm giving this a 1/10 because it has no value, and I left the theater in a worse state than I went in."
negative,"There's not much to say about the movie, to be honest. Every year, we've been watching a lot of average Marvel movies, series, and mini-series.The worst thing about this film was that it had a lot of problems showing Kang's power, especially in the scene where Ant-Man and Wasp fought him in the last scene, the cheesiness annoyed me.The acting, script, directorial skill, even the progress and handling of the revolutionary theme in the final scene, everything was very normal and ordinary. We've seen too many similar things in many works.The part I liked was the good visualization of the quantum dimension, which was very Star Wars themed. Especially the first scene with quantum was great in the cinema. Also, the adaptation of MODOK character to the cinematic universe was good, but his dialogues and death made me extremely sad because they were bad.In short, there was nothing extra in the movie, it was watchable but the forced joke attempts and poorly executed villain characters ruined the movie. Marvel needs to be more careful now, and realize that spending a lot of money doesn't make a good movie. I think the writers, especially in Phase 4, need to accept the fact that they are doing a bad job and choose a different path. Finally, I should add that the mid-credit scene was really bad, the voice changing was cringe-worthy. It's an average movie that can be watched."
positive,"Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichés, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution."
negative,"Take Marvels recent lacklustre offerings, add some Avatar visuals and the dialogue and acting of the last few Star Wars films, and you have this. It's cheesy, in the extreme. It's chock full of the usual tropes and character motivators that plague Marvel films. It feels like we are being force fed the same story, over and over, in all their films. Most of the characters are unlikeable, shallow and forgettable. I stopped caring about any of them about 20, yawn inducing, minutes in. This is not good film making. Loud colours, over the top character dynamics and a weak plot, do not give you a good film. I felt like I was watching garishly dressed, looking for laughs and attention, annoyances. Clowns, in other words. I felt like I was watching clowns. And that makes me so sad."
positive,"Quantimania is a strange a little movie. It tries to be an adventure movie, an Ant-Man movie and almost an avenger movie of sorts. There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang."
positive,"7 is well-deserved but wanted to give 8 just because I think 6.6 is not enough.Very good movie. No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful."
negative,"Scott Skywalker, Princess Hope, Obi-Wan Hank and Cassie-Rey face off against the villainous Darth Kang who has created a Multi-Verse Killer.Kang is being protected by Quantum Realm Troopers who guard his sky city against a group of resistance fighters looking to take back their planet.Overall a pretty good film. Not great, but not bad. It was Marvel without being overtly Marvel. Very thin, somewhat predictable plot without any surprises or twist. But some great visuals, some decent action sequences and a few good laughs.I saw the 3D version which was decent. No distracting gimmicks. Just some good added depth."
negative,"The MCU used to be something I would get excited about. While obviously not artistic masterpieces, the MCU used to be fun popcorn entertainment that would be a good way to take your family to the theater and be entertained by charming characters and fun action sequences. Now, it's a pale shadow of what it used to be and seems to only get butts in seats based on brand recognition alone.Pretty much everything I hated about phase 4 is on full display here. The writing is juvenile, the visual effects are atrocious, the humor is obnoxious, the ""emotional"" scenes don't work and all of the characters are hollow and uninteresting. Although I did enjoy the post credits scene and a couple of moments scattered throughout the film, I was begging for this one to just end as it is 2 hours long yet it felt like 4 hours.I'm so sick and tired of this franchise that I really want it to die. After Guardians 3, I might be tapping out completely."
positive,"This movie was not as bad as everyone is claiming. Is it of the same caliber as Lord of the Rings.... No. However, based on them having to make a movie about Antman and the Wasp, while at the same time having to set up the next phase of Marvel, I thought they did a great job. It was a fun movie and the visuals I thought were great.I thought the acting was great and the story moved along well. It was the first movie I've seen with Jonathan Majors and I thought he did an amazing job and I'm excited to check out some of his other acting credits.I went in to this with lower expectations because I haven't been wild about the new content from the MCU but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.I know some people were upset with how MODOK was portrayed but I thought they did a great job making him a fun addition. There is no way to make MODOK in a live action movie serious. So making him the butt of a joke was a great way to add him.I recommend giving this movie a shot."
positive,"The movie sets up the future of MCU but as an individual story it's not that great. The storyline is too obvious and no elements of suprise & twist. From acting point of view the movie looses its string on emotional pov, especially the father - daughter chemistry of Scott & Cassy. Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.Overall an one time watch. The movie has 2 post credit scenes and both are important for future."
negative,"MCU is dead. It is official. They can't produce any good movie anymore. It would be a safe bet to not watch their upcoming movies as they will involve this lethargic concept of multi-verse. How much of the same thing with the only difference of theme can people keep watching?About this movie, the story is meh, full of cliches, and the plot is quite predictable. It is nothing like the first ant-man movie.Animations are overdone, very flashy sometimes and not good for weak eyes. They aren't beautiful either.Only save here is the acting by senior actors.Verdict: save your money and time. Don't watch."
positive,"So this is rated about the same as Thor love and thunder? Really? Love and thunder was a bad film, this really isn't in the same league! I really enjoyed it, took it for what it was, some entertainment in a make believe world. Wasn't disappointed.Yes Marvel are churning out films like kids for child support.. doesn't mean they are all bad.. this seems to be the popular notion and go to criticism. Looking forward to seeing where the new story arc goes, hope they don't pull a love and thunder with the next Guardians film!In short, watch it, don't take it seriously and just enjoy it.. you won't be disappointed."
positive,"The movie is what it is; just for fun. Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun."
positive,"As a kid, I read and re-read Marvel Premiere #47, which showed how Scott Lang became Ant-Man. Written by David Michelinie and drawn by X-Men team of teams John Byrne and Terry Austin, it was a story I read and re-read and if you have ever seen the way I draw comic books, so much of it comes from this issue.So when it comes to that whole ""Are comics cinema?"" back and forth argument, I think you can figure out what side I'm on. Are there too many comic book movies? Were there too many giallo from 1970-1975? Did Italy make too many Westerns? Were there too many slashers in 1981? Can there be too much of something that you love?Alright, now that I have gotten past the legally required nod to serious criticism, let me tell you why I enjoyed this movie about humanoid broccoli.After the Avengers save everything from Thanos, former criminal and current Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled down from being Ant-Man, instead enjoying life as a writer, husband of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and father of Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), who is upset that her father isn't fighting for people any longer, instead enjoying the fruits of his hard work and resting on his laurels. There's a moment that's interesting here, as she discusses all the people who were displaced in the time where Thanos killed half of reality and now are homeless. Yes, it'd be great to explore this but this is a popcorn movie that soon moves past that; I'm not suggesting a popcorn movie delve into that, but hey, if there ends up being a Disney+ D-Man series that does, I'd watch that. Also, the fact that I just casually namedropped D-Man should explain why I never went to the prom.Anyways, Cassie has been working with her stepmother Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to communicate with the Quantum Realm, the place where Hank's wife Janey Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years of her life and has no interest in going back, particularly when it comes to explaining her past or unleashing new Marvel Cinematic Universe big bad Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, who is quite frankly amazing in this movie and brings a real sense of big drama to his role, not to mention all the various - oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING, I forgot that legal disclaimer -versions of Kang that he shows off, including Immortus, Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion and Victor Timely).Everyone soon gets pulled into that Quantum Realm and becomes part of the war between its inhabitants, with good rebels Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, who was already part of the MCU as Kimball in Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., as well as Major Sarah Grey in the DC superhero TV series Black Lightning and a comms officer on The Mandalorian; if you really want me to go full geek, she's a member of former Micronauts leader Commander Arcturus Rann's Enigma Force alongside other non-Mego owned characters Marionette and Bug; one more semicolon but man, this movie is as close as we're ever getting to a Michael Golden-era Micronauts movie), telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper; he's not Quasar, as many Marvel fans thought, but when he does pull a password out of someone's mind at one point, it's 18147, which would be Avengers #181, Scott Lang's first appearance, and a shout out to the aforementioned Marvel Premiere #47), the slime creature with no holes named Veb (David Dastmalchian, who was Kurt in the last two Ant-Man movies, Abra Kadabra on The Flash and Polka Dot Man in Suicide Squad), the flashlight head Xolum (James Cutler) and oh yeah, there's Bill Murray as Lando Calrissian (I kid, he's Lord Krylar, another of the characters like Jentorra who come from K'ai, the microplanet where the Hulk met one of the loves of his life Jarella) battling Kang and his Tron: Legacy-looking soldiers like he's Baron Karza or something.Anyways, yes, this all feels rather like Star Wars but then again isn't Star Wars influenced if not ripped off from Jack Kirby's Fourth World? Kirby invented most of the MCU and rebelling against a dark authority is pretty much an archetype. Where this gets kind of operatic is that Ant-Man is, well, an ant against space god Kang and that's a battle that I never saw coming.I also never thought I'd see MODOK (Machine Organism Designed Only for Killing) in a movie, much less one that fully embraces the absolutely goofy idea of a giant head in a chair with weapons and baby legs. Also, this ends up being former Yellowjacket Darren Cross from the first movie and every time his real face shows up, it breaks the movie but it's a welcome break in the movie.You can imagine - and you'd be right - that the good guys win but this movie brings up an interesting idea that you can't just punch Kang, who lives his life across multiple timelines that are not linear and that this Kang may not be the worst of the many Kangs. Then Scott brushes it off and tries to enjoy some Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake (the fact that the ice cream chain has no tie-in flavor and yet had a Condorman flavor back in the 80s is kind of upsetting).In the same way that politics - nice socialism shoutout with the ants in this - just leads to people not listening to one another, a lot of folks have their minds made up about comic book movies which are really just mythology and should be seen as such. That said, this movie did what all popcorn films should: it entertained me. I think it's hilarious that one of the film's writers, Jeff Loveness, said that this movie is ""Jodorowsky's Dune within Marvel"" and there are not enough drugs in the world to show you what Alejandro Jodorowsky would do with a Marvel film but hey, he also did The Incal in comics form, so when you denigrate comics, keep in mind that a hero of cinema spent so much of his time there.I explained to my wife tonight that as a kid, there I never really wanted to get involved in human drama or how stressful some extended family members could be, so I just filled my life with comic books. Often when we talk on the phone, my mom will say, ""Do you remember this person,"" and the answer is no, I do not remember this person. However, if she asked, ""Was Wolverine really in World War 2?"" I could give her several anecdotes and explain how Black Widow could be young and yet still saved by Logan and Captain America in 1941.So yeah, I liked this movie."
positive,"Just finished watching the movie at the cinema and it was really awesome. Great fun and a lot of sci fi. Yes, it wasn't a grand plot like end-game. But still very entertaining and packed. Movie was clean and story was good. Plus it ties to the next phase of marvel movies. I assume low reviews are because people were comparing it to some great ones as the story could have been better and perhaps some might think it's a little random. But for those who are not so attached to the perfect marvel story. It's great. I would definitely give it a go. I watched it in 3D and CGI and effects were also pretty good. There are 2 credit scenes. Enjoy :)"
positive,"Aa a solo movie ye ek acchi movie hai...
Acchi comedy+ badiya action seen hai...Kang the conqueror 🔥🤙 like ek baap level villen ki filling deta he ye banda .End fight.... Kang v/s Lang are amazing 😍It is best antman movie in terms of action.This film have two post credit scene
Both are good 👍
My personal favourite post credit scene are mid-credit scene in which we see counsel of Kang..... it's a amezing seen😊Overall dekhe to achhi movie hai...
I don't know log iss movie ko hate kyu de rahe hai...i think log endgame & infinity war se compare kar rahe hai iss liye hate kar he...
But hamko iss picture ko as a solo movie Leni chahiye....it is a good movie i give 9/10👍😊"
positive,"We go down into the quantum world and enter planet cgi. Apart from the actors everything is CGI. There are strange creatures and landscapes. There are people who for the most part are similar to human, body, 2 arms, 2 legs etc. But with various different heads. There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.The plot is acceptable and the villain is great. He's definitely menacing. They're so confident of him they say he'll be back.So enjoy. Ant-man and the wasp will win but they left a let out for a sequel."
negative,"With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
positive,"This movie was great. The cgi gave me a little bit of a headache but not a migraine or anything. Also this movie is more serious instead of funny. They have jokes in the movie every now and then, but not so much. I don't really like how they handled
M. O. D. O. K. But he was funny and has an exciting return from a previous character. Kang is really scary and disturbing. There is two bonus scenes in total. One of them is a great way to show the future of the multiverse saga and the second one made me jump out of my seat because I was so happy. This film was a great way to open up phase five.8/10."
positive,"Jonathan Majors performance as 'Kang The Conqueror' is praise worthy, he delivers it with great intensity. Kang chaos is kicked off for the 'Multiverse Saga', with this entry movie of MCU Phase 5. Entertainment is filled with humorous comedy and action that MCU delivers as always. Adventure of quantum realm with good screen time is key to this movie, and you will love to see good family drama enhanced. Lower your expectation and enjoy this movie in 3D, I don't understand why is this movie getting such rotten reviews. Wait until last before getting of your seats, those two P. C. S . Is awesome, it won't let you disappoint."
negative,"Where do you start with Quantumania?It's an absolute mess of a movie and the demise of the Marvel Universe speeds up.The biggest threat to the multiverse and beyond isn't Kang or Thanos or Dr. Doom or whoever.It's the writing committees that have pretty much written everything since End Game.It's been downhill since then with a few decent moments in between.Quantumania is terrible. Wait for it to show on Disney if you must. Or, you could do yourself a favour and give it a wide berth. It has none of the charm of the previous two films and absolute zero jeopardy.There is nothing on the line because Kang can jump back and forward through time through multiple personalities. So nothing matters."
positive,"The third movie was totally different than the previous movies. It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang. We get to see a throwback segment and find out more about Kang and Janet's time when she vanished into the quantum level."
negative,"Ant-Man's third installment in the MCU the start of the great phase 5 woohoo!! Bringing in the with bang Kang the next big baddie in MCU after Thanos, or did they??....For some reason even after a very bad 2nd movie I was excited to see this 3rd installment and see how the character of Kang would be portrayed in the movie, but after watching it while the performance of Jonathan majors was standout, I was left underwhelmed. Its just another Marvel movie with a lot of shortcomings in the storyline. The plot felt uninspired just like the previous one without bringing anything new to the table.The Movie in its core the movie lacks proper development even though the movie had some beautiful visual effects they only feel to serve as distraction from the weak plot. Its basically all just CG other than maybe the faces of some at times .If you are also someone who used to love Marvel and was hoping that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania would get the MCU back on track after several disappointing entries and you can safely avoid to go out of your way to watch this. 6 is for real generous for this."
negative,"Negatives: No Michael Peña/Luis (in a freaking Ant Man movie which he's always in), ridiculous scenes and dialogue that seemed to be written by children (I trusted you, you gave your word when he didn't know Kang at all, etc), MODOK and how dumb he was/looked and his character's lines (he did not need to be in the movie), and then playing the pronoun game earlier in the movie way too much and how they kept saying ""him, he"" etc talking about Kang just to build tension which got annoying at a certain point.Positives: Kang was a cool and powerful villain and Jonathan Majors acted very well and I can't wait to see him in Creed 3, Paul Rudd did well as Scott Lang as always and his humor worked, and the world building and effects/green screen looked really good and it was creative what they did with the quantum realm.Overall it wasn't a bad movie, the story was good but it had parts that made me cringe pretty hard. I'd much rather rewatch the first one or second one (which are more original and funnier)."
negative,"I didnt hate this movie since Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas were really good and made it worth the watch. Paul Rudd ruins it IMO and I can hardly stand him and will never understand why they chose him to play a super hero in the first place. I loved the world building in this movie. The wife, Evaneline Lilly? Has no business playing Michelle Pfeiffers daughter, she looked the same age or just a few years younger. Who cast Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother? She looked great IMO and was just awesome. I'm truly tired of these Marvel movies, but since not much else is being made, and I thought this one would be interesting, I went to see it. Its better than nothing, so I gave it 6 stars. The actor playing the bad guy was great too."
positive,"Surprise! I really enjoyed this movie, which was surprising as it seems to be getting lambasted by critics and audiences alike. And on one hand, I can understand; people are getting superhero fatigue, and Ant-Man never was the most popular character out there. On the other hand, this third entry in the ""Ant-Man"" series of films is a science-fiction adventure that I, for one, couldn't get enough of.If you're a fan of straight up sci-fi, I honestly can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this movie; virtually from beginning to end, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an exercise in engaging world building and incredible visuals - on a purely visual aspect this movie is a 10 out of 10; the movie takes viewers through a world - a universe - that is so interesting to look at that I found myself almost jaw-dropped for 90% of this film's runtime. But of course, great visuals can only take a movie so far.Luckily, ""Quantumania"" delivers on pretty much every other aspect as well. With fantastic chemistry between its main characters, the film is a sheer delight to watch in terms of characterization and character interaction. Paul Rudd is charismatic as usual, but I was even more impressed with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton; you'd think the ridiculous subject matter would lead to ridiculous performances, but they're all bringing their A-game here, which was unexpected but appreciated. Now I know what you're thinking: ""How was Jonathan Majors?"" Let's talk about it.Introducing a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania"" is apparently setting up the next biggest Marvel baddie. And while I found Kang to have a lot of potential, I wasn't particularly impressed with his villainy here, as much as I enjoyed Majors in the role. While Majors adds a cold menace to the character, I found a lot of Kang's dialogue to be trite and evil for the sake of being evil. While his initial introduction is more nuanced, the film foregoes that, and instead makes the character extremely one dimensional. That said, I did feel as if he was a worthy enough opponent in this movie, and I am interested to see the future development of this character.If you're going to see an MCU movie, you most likely care about the action; while ""Quantumania"" didn't have a ton of action in it (the movie focuses more on adventure than action), the action it did have satisfied me. While the action is extremely CGI heavy for the most part, I found it exciting in its sci-fi centricity - it really felt like I was watching a ""Star Trek"" movie, and while some people may not like that, I absolutely loved it.Overall, I had a fantastic time with this movie. Audiences seem to be turning on Ant-Man and on the MCU in general, but I found this to be a refreshing take on the genre with its emphasis on pure science-fiction adventure. You may not enjoy this as much as I did, but if you're a Marvel fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch."
positive,"One of the most fun and weird movies I've seen in a while, which is mostly a compliment. I liked it! It was fun! I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of creatively new designs the quantum realm yielded, the probability storm scene in particular was one of my favorite MCU movie sequences of the past couple years. It really felt like a colorful comic book come to life. The blobby guy was a scene-stealer, though obviously he didn't reach the sheer comedic prowess of Luis, who was missed here. The Pym-Lang family were a great cast of characters to watch and even if the other 2 Ant-Man films may be the better two because of the tonal difference, it was still interesting to see them face a larger-scale threat, and the final battle of the civilians and the heroes versus Kang's army felt very tense and exciting....where has Jonathan Majors been the past decade?? This man can act like nobody's business. Kang was easily one of the best parts of the movie, his backstory with Janet was really intriguing and his unrelenting coldness in his methods was chilling, as was his massive displays of power. It'll be awesome to see him again down the road. MODOK was cool and funny, until his mask came off and I felt as though someone had poured sodium chloride into my eyeballs. Bill Murray was good but underused. I wished there was a little more time spent in San Fransisco (Jimmy Woo!) it felt like we had just barely re-established the characters before they were thrown into the quantum realm. Also, the second trailer for this movie made it seem as though Kang was going to tempt Scott with helping him regain time with Cassie that he lost over the blip, with dialogue that I'm pretty sure wasn't in the Final Cut discussing it (Kang even tells Janet at one point that he could send her back before she ever left her own family). I'm surprised they didn't go this route in the movie, instead having Kang's end of the bargain only being to not kill all of them. Overall though, the movie was really fun, weird, and visually pleasing, and a great time at the movies. The stakes felt higher than most MCU movies since we know Kang is going to be the next big villain and it felt like anything could happen with the timeline.Now, my opinion on the MCU movie prejudice that seems to be growing and growing: People keep dissing on these movies because they're not as 'refined' or something as other movies out there, but It's unfair to compare completely different genres with each other. People that want to say the MCU is too ""VFX heavy"" or ""Unserious"" need to realize that that's exactly what these types of movies are here to provide for audiences: a colorful, funny, adventurous story filled with superpowered heroes that fight evil. And audiences eat it up every time, it's clear that MCU movies are connecting with the general moviegoing public because every single release is a hit (some smaller than others, but still successful) and people keep coming back for more. Those who want to take shots at the aspects of MCU movies that are integral parts of MCU movies should just watch something else. I completely understand disliking these movies if one thinks they contain weaker superhero stories or weaker VFX or weaker comedy than usual, but one can't complain about it the existence of these different aspects in general when they're just pillars of what makes an MCU movie that people keep on coming back to for more. Sure, Quantumania wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a perfectly satisfying and fun romp through a superhero-filled world, which is exactly what I expected from it. If I wanted a movie without these aspects, I wouldn't watch it. Hope that made sense, and here's to more fun MCU outings.*exhales* but anyways, cool film. OWEN WILSON!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Man, this product has no reason to exists.Most of it is just talking in 3 locations. Half or it is just talking in 3 locations.The CGI gets boring very quickly. This is effectively an aminated product.The Wasp saved this product, while the old lady is in there the most and dictates this product. Makes me wonder, why it is considered an ""Antman"" product.Deus-Ex-Ant-Machina. They just pull it out of thin air and it makes no sense.Kang is insanely boring. All he can is building B-Level storm troopers. And shoot laser that vaporizes people.The Stormtroopers did nothing. They lost against guys with swords.The ""Massage"" of capitalism bad and socialism good is insulting. The makers clearly never seen what happened to the ideologies when millions of people were killed and had to suffer for ""utopia""."
positive,"After reading some reviews, I thought it's going to be terrible and was expecting disappoint. However, it was actually decent movie. J Major did a awesome job playing Kang. Also if you've watched Loki season 1 on Disney then you'll understand the story line much better. I do feel like they could have taken a bigger risk with the story line. There are two end credit scene, I believe it was worth it staying for the first end credit scene but not the last end credit scene. All it did was setup a Disney plus series.My final advise would be to rewatch Loki season 1 before going to watch quantanmania."
negative,"""Phase Five"", ""Kang the conqueror"", ""multiverse"" --- it all sounds so monumental, but looks so tottering.Great visual effect (shout out to the VFX workers), as illustrated in a motley of scenic, architectural, and environmental designs; especially the long shot of the flight sequence, which captures the flamboyant otherworldliness of quantum realm. Action wise, the movie presents a short yet meticulous combat scene between Kang and the Ant-family, displaying tacit combos and fluent choreography. Moreover, giant Ant-Man demolishing the citadels is quite similar to AOT, and the way Kang suspends the hurtling cane gives me Kylo Ren vibes, not to mention the quantum species are really comparable to the aliens of Star Wars, which are all nice little allusions in my opinion but could be a sign of Marvel's creativity fatigue. And here goes the negatives.I'm sorry, but Cassie's actress is terrible at portraying her character, showing no emotions facially or within the eyes when her father falls off a cliff or gets beaten to death by the villain, which contrasts farcically to her anxious voice. Introducing terrible ""New Avengers"" is hereditary as we've seen in Phase Four (Iron Heart, Kate Bishop, America), which is why Stinger is even more frustrating and illogical of a character: unreasonably caring, doted by her family, and excuse me incited a local rebellion as a two-day visitor? Speaking of which, the rebels demonstrate so potent a motive with so little characterization, as they seem even less important to the plot development that actual ants. And speaking of ants, how in the flabbergasted-ness do ants overpower the timeline-shattering Thor-killing multiverse-conquering Kang? I understand how Jonathan Majors is grinding to perform this so-called ""ultimate antagonist"" of Phase Five and Six with contorted facial expressions and balefully imperious tone, yet Kang's failure in the film simply makes this villain far less menacing. Though titled ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", the movie leaves no room for Scott (I'm sorry Paul you tried) or Hope (basically Black Widow but only the stingers) to literally and figuratively ""grow"" as main characters. Michelle and Michael's chemistry is the only landing ground for comedy (oh yeah the jokes suck btw); though in terms of between-character scenes, I loved the backstory of Janet and Kang, as their brief interaction exhibits a mother's yearning and a warrior's sympathy with pure dialogues and micro-expressions, which in turn deepens the duo's contradiction.If this was a film of Phase Four, I'd let it slide with a 7/10. However, we're in a new Phase with new expectations, and the customers will not be satiated with Marvel serving the same meal as before."
negative,"What the hell did I just watch? And the answer is: a movie written by 3rd graders with cognitive issues.This movie was so basic, so annoying most of the time I had to go for bathroom breaks around 6 times. Jesus, what a waste. A movie made to scratch egos of lesser directors and actors.Full of politics and propaganda and not enough action. Ant man gets a backseat in his own movie. What the hell MCU? Or should I say MSHEU. Teenage girl that creates complex machinery in her bedroom? Seriously? Its like it was written by the writing team of She Hulk.Hot garbage and nothing else. Not even mildly entertaining, unless you've never seen a movie in your life."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is the third installment in the Ant-Man franchise and the first film in Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as they explore the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dimension where they encounter strange creatures and a powerful villain named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).The film has a lot of visual spectacle and creativity, as it showcases the wonders and dangers of the Quantum Realm. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining, especially when Ant-Man and Wasp use their shrinking and growing abilities to fight their enemies. The film also introduces some new characters, such as Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter who becomes a political activist, and Jentorra (Katy O'Brian), a Mandalorian-like warrior who helps them in their quest.However, the film also suffers from some flaws that prevent it from being a great movie. The plot is convoluted and messy, as it tries to juggle too many elements and subplots without giving them enough development or coherence. The film also lacks the humor and charm that made the previous Ant-Man movies so enjoyable, as it takes itself too seriously and loses some of the fun factor. The film also makes some tonal departures from the earlier films, as it deals with darker themes such as trauma, guilt, and genocide.The most disappointing aspect of the film is Kang the Conqueror, who is supposed to be the new main antagonist of the MCU. While Jonathan Majors gives a good performance, his character is poorly written and underdeveloped. He is introduced too abruptly and without much explanation or motivation, making him seem like a generic and bland villain. He also does not pose much of a threat to Ant-Man and Wasp, as they easily defeat him in the end.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some positive aspects, such as the visual effects, the action scenes, and some of the performances, but it also has some negative aspects, such as the plot, the screenplay, and Kang the Conqueror. It is not a terrible movie, but it is not a great one either. It is a mediocre movie that could have been much better."
negative,"The introduction into the Quantum realm really gave me Star Wars vibes and I would say that's a good thing. The character designs were great. The plot and backstory for why things were happening was explained well and easy to follow. All the characters from the previous films played their roles well.As far as new characters, Kang was excellent. Though he didn't show off too much of his powers. I wasn't expecting him to so I wasn't disappointed. I would say towards the end, the film did make him seem a bit weak. Great character played by a great actor nonetheless.Modok could have been better. His initial look was fine but once his true identity was revealed that's when he looked weird. They could have done with working on that CGI or not show that version of him that many times once they showed who he truly was. He was used too much for comedic relief and towards the end it was a bit much.The action in the film was entertaining but nothing over the top.The dialogue and forced comedy towards the end is what brings this movie down a bit. There were bits of dialogue/scenes that could have been taken out and the film would have been much stronger. Specifically from Modok and Ant-man's daughter and like one line from Kang.Overall it was another entertaining Ant-man movie that didn't disappoint. Don't believe the Critics, enjoy the film."
negative,"AMWQ is a good movie, full of exciting special effects, a powerful bad guy, lots of action and a spattering of comedy mixed in. Unfortunately, it stuck to the same cookie-cutter format that the MCU has been relying on, post EndgameI guess that could be considered good or bad news, depending on what you like to see. But I will say this, watching MCU movies as of late is like eating pizza everyday for, like, a couple of weeks straight. Love pizza, but too much of a good thing is never a good thing. I'm still waiting for something in these new Phases of the MCU to move me like I was moved in the early years of the MCU. Sadly, AMWQ doesn't do anything for me.I still don't know why Infinity War and Endgame seemed so damned good. I guess Infinity War and, to an extent, Endgame had more humanity to it. Those movies had character growth, more emotional interaction, more substance to who the actual players were and how they tied into the plots. Those movies surely had better quality writing, and the acting, as I remember it, was also much better than what I've seen in recent MCU movies. What I've noticed is that the MCU is trading quality scriptwriting for CGI, and the narratives are now focused on female heroes, and genius children/teen, whom also tend to be MENSA level scientist and inventors. I'm not stating that those people don't exists, but it's being overdone, almost forced on us (remember the pizza analogy).Couple this with some very poor writing (the way MODOK was challenged to conversion via a flurry of ""d*ck"" references was disgusting and cheap).So, yeah, Ant-Man/Quantomania is a good enough movie. It was fun to watch, and it will make money. I guess all these MCU movies will make money until they don't...which probably means people are finally getting sick of pizza.6/10 fun, but nothing unique here."
positive,"Antman and the wasp:quantumaniaI have a big hope for this movie due to it achievements from the previous movie.i got from ear to ear that this movie have a lot of action coming but here is the thing,it got 6.5 IMDB and 47 %in rotten tomato. I have a mix reaction for this movie.to Find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. Without further rido,so sit back tight and enjoy my review for this movie:-this is a slow pace movie and a pinch of comedic natural.-the cinematography in this movie is pretty decent and above average for marvel studious(bruh)
-this movie has also has a family moral and I suggest to watch this movie with your family.-i think I would suggest you watch the guardian of galaxy and the previous movie to totally understand the flow of the movie.-well quantum exist in real life but scientists could never implement it.so sad.-as the typical marvel movie well someone would recommend not to do it but someone eager to do it and all of them is in trouble.( Yeah, I know ,pretty typical)
-the graphic is magnificent and above average.i think marvel actually learn from the previous movie (if you know what I'm saying).-it has a pretty strict conflict between the family.this movie has a lot of comedic in it to crunch my soreness in this movie-i would say this movie is pretty adventurous and has many things going on
it has a backstory from jannet that you need to focus in this movie-the action was one of the best in my carrier.the camera angle and many thing is scripted perfectly.-the ending is pretty decent and it's just it you know what I meantRating:
Plot:7/10
Pacing: 6/10
Cinematography:9/10
Characters: 8/10
Actor:10/10
Affects:7/10
Overall:8.5/10."
positive,"The first two Ant Man movies the quantum realm was talked about, but in Quantumania we now see it first hand. Scott and family find themselves pulled into the quantum realm, only to discover it's also another universe, and Janets past quickly comes back to haunt her.Jonathan Majors really blew me away has the villian Kang, givin a type Darth Vader like performance, even with his calmness you clearly see the insanity in him. Paul Rudd once again brings likable comic charm, Michael Douglas was good, so was Evanegline Lilly and Michelle Pfieffer. Sometimes Kathryn Newton was annoying , but other times she was good. The effects are awesome, I love the star wars like adventure."
positive,"I don't write reviews for movies very often. I feel compelled to do so for this new because of four things: I'm a MCU fan, I enjoy movies, I want Marvel Studios to keep entertaining us with great quality stories, and I am very concerned now with what I've seen with the last few movies. This one is no exception.Don't get me wrong. There is a lot to love about this film. I found the strange world of the quantum realm very imaginative and vast. I like what's going on with the story centering on the Pym & Lang families. I even love the moments with Jonathan Majors's Kang.But... there were too many plot holes, pointless scenes, and certain characters this movie REALLY did not need. Especially in the third act with the big battle when the real action finally picked up. Too bad. I really wanted to love this film."
negative,"It started off well. The bits set in the real world have humour and character.Then they go to the quantum realm and it falls apart. The vast majority of the film is CGI. Endless CGI. Too much CGI. Seen it all before.We are expected to care about a war happening in the quantum realm between two factions its hard to care about. We are told which side we should root for.Then at the end we are told we might have rooted for the wrong side - it might not be as simple as we thought.Then in true Marvel style something weird happens that has you questioning everything, including whether its worth it at all as they can now throw away all rules required for something to be realistic and have something we can root for, and do what they like.Paul Rudd can't save it, watchable as he is.Michelle Pfeiffer is miscast.Michael Douglas is under used, restricted largely to comic relief.The whole film is started by the actions of three characters who should know better, and if they behaved as they would in reality would never have carried out the actions that cause them all to be sucked into the quantum realm. Of course they shouldn't have been messing with what they were messing with... (Makes it even less believable).Might have worked better at 90 minutes - the length such movies used to - and should - be."
positive,"So I actually really enjoyed this movie it was a lot of fun. It was funny, it was very interesting, I like how they're building up the story and yet it's not going to be some huge monumental thing like Infinity War but if you just watch it for what it is it really is a great movie. The action was great I do think that it would be cool to have a little bit more of Kangs power shown but he was still awesome in the movie itself. If you get a chance definitely watch the Loki show it ties in with it a little bit. Stop putting movies on such a pedestal to be 10 at a tens just watch it for what they are and you'll enjoy them a lot more. I can't wait to see how much more kangs character evolves in the upcoming movies."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania:Take me back to reality please! Ant-Man and the Wasp find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible.The third installment of the Ant-Man trilogy doesn't feel like an Ant-Man movie at all. Scott Lang was anything but the main character in the movie. I would've preferred if the Ant-Man was the main focus of the movie. Another problem I had with the movie was that it was all set in the quantam realm meaning that everything you see is CGI and fake. It looked cool at the first glance but as the movie progressed, it started to become more and more annoying. Just show me something real please! Additionally, the CGI and green screen weren't really that good. I could see Paul Rudd's outline in some scenes. Also, the acting of some of the cast was pretty bad especially with the very basic dialogue.Kang just stole the show. His backstory was very well written and his character had so much depth. His fight scenes with Ant-Man were so good and entertaining to watch. Jonathan Majors as Kang maybe one of the best villains in the MCU and I'm very glad he'll be sticking with us for a long while. The movie had it's funny bits but some jokes weren't really that funny.Score:6/10."
negative,"Where do I even start with this boring, exposition-drenched Star Wars wannabe?I guess I'll start at when I knew the movie was going to be trash. At the beginning of the movie, Ant-Man has to go down to the local police station to pick up his daughter from jail. She was arrested because the police were tasked with clearing out a homeless encampment (in reality, encampments are a serious crime issue on the West coast), but Ant-Man's daughter didn't like that, so she destroyed police equipment. The next scene at dinner, Hank Pym said he would've marched in there and broken her out of jail. Why is Marvel pushing anti-policing/anti-justice and having a teenage girl as their ""martyr"" or spokesperson or whatever. Shouldn't the Marvel heroes be working together with the police to stop crime? What is this leftist gibberish? I have grown to expect this from Marvel after the Disney acquisition, but man were the politics extra loud in this movie.Regardless of the extreme leftist political pandering written by someone who is completely detached from actual society and the real world being forced onto us, the movie was still trash. Kang was an absolute joke of a villain in this movie. I have no idea how they plan(ned) on making him the new big bad, someone on Thanos's level after what I just saw. The action was so boring and drab because you know everyone's going to be fine. There's no sense of danger or risk that something won't go as planned. So many scenes and sets were just blatantly ripped from A New Hope it's honestly pathetic.I know Disney owns Marvel and Star Wars, but keep them separate. Let them have their own feel to them, like back when the first Avengers came out. That movie had its own unique feel/aura and has aged extremely well. Marvel movies are now too busy pandering to politics to tell an interesting story with real fleshed out characters dealing with serious issues that have consequences. It feels like every Marvel movie is trying to be Thor Ragnarok now, and that only spells disaster.I'm more sad than mad. I thought this movie looked decent from the trailers too. After this, I don't think the days of actual quality films like Iron Man or Avengers are coming back, not from Disney.The most criminal thing about this movie is they somehow even made Paul Rudd unlikable.2/10."
negative,"Pretty average, it feels like a lot of movie tropes slapped together. There were some good moments but everything was really reduced to a punchline in the end (Kinda like Love & Thunder). There were some emotional tones but nothing really sticks together. Doesn't help that everything except the main cast faces is extremely obvious CGI. Not much room for disbelief to be suspended. I did like the villains for the most part, Kang is definitely not a Thanos (yet), but he has the right tone and I like that he is considerably different from Thanos. The rest of the characters are just kinda rediculous and the Quantum Realm is apparently just a big Star Wars cantina. I was happy surprised with MODOK, except it just end with him being essentially a joke, like many good things in this film."
positive,"I am a marvel fan. Iron man to ant man the wasp all movie i watched. Every marvel movies are very good. But now a days i dont feel like those 2010-2020 years movies of marvel. Avangers movies are another level entertainment. But this movie also good. Movie like iron man, captain america,, avangers infinity war i watched them 3-4 times. Thats movies are attractive for me. But nowadays some marvel movies like antman not have old marvel movies vipes. A man who never watched marvel movies,, this movie are very very enjoying movie for him. But a marvel fan alltime wants avengers types movies where every marvel superhero fight to save the planet."
positive,"Caught an advanced screening of this tonight & despite the negative reviews I had read this was pleasantly surprising for me. The blend of action, storytelling & comedy was much better balanced than recent Marvel films, the visual effects were beautiful, also much better than recent additions. I did enjoy the first two Ant-Man's better than this one but found this one was most definitely worth a trip to the cinema. Kathryn Newton very well casted for Cassie & adds well to the movie. Some moments with Scott were really beautifully done along with some humour, especially early on. Cassie's admiration for Jentorra was really cool & the 'just stop being a dick' to Darren (who returns in a funny way) was brilliant. Loved Paul Rudd's delivery of this line:
Kang: You're not the one with the hammer?Scott: That's Thor. We get confused a lot. Similar body types.Overall this movie is better than a lot of recent marvel films but not as good as the franchise once was. There are two credit scenes, one near the start of the credits & one right at the end."
positive,"I have had the privilege and fortune to be able to watch it on opening day in 3D. I personally mostly enjoyed it, but I found some flaws with it.Let's get to the positives first. Majors was genuinely threatening and scary as Kang, his gravitas being genuinely scary and chilling for the entire multiverse. He has managed to be a legitimate contender to Thanos' throne as MCU's biggest villain yet. Another positive I can note is the humor. Now, I did not laugh out loud at every single joke that the film had to offer, but its heart was mostly genuine, and some of it did land. (MODOK's appearance was ironically pretty funny to me, the CGI monstrosity was... something.)Now let me get to the negatives. If it weren't for the fact I watched it in 3D, I think it would be obvious most of the time that they are on a green screen in a CGI world. The creatures in the Quantum Realm were mostly uninspired. It was clear they had taken references from other sources and... eh. It kinda looked busy.The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he lives his life in San Francisco. It all starts off normally until his daughter, Cassie, gets freed from prison after she was in some sort of protest or whatever? Then they go to Hank's lab or something and they discover that they can communicate with the Quantum Realm. That machine goes wrong and they get transported into the Quantum Realm. They find their way in, learn a bunch of customs and, after drinking some slime, can communicate with whatever creatures there are in this realm.Then at some point, Ant-Man, Hope, Hank, Cassie and all the others get separated, things go on, Bill Murray appears and is freaking cool, at some point there comes Kang, some more things happen, then it really begins to end when Ant-Man, Hope and Cassie stand alongside Kang, and Kang says ""I conquer worlds, you talk with ants"" and Hank just comes with a CGI army of ants to save the day, and then they're in some tower and the little guy has to sacrifice, then it's kinda bittersweet.Fine plot, it works, it was entertaining, but honestly I liked what 3D could bring to me and my favorite part was when the screen went dark and he got into the nucleum and there was the Storm of Possibilities, pretty cool CGI. Entertaining, good as an introduction to Kang, but not much else. Could have been a lot better."
positive,"Sometimes a movie over sells itself with all the previews and such so that your expectations are based on what you thought you would see. The first 30 minutes therefore thrilled me with its humor and unfolding plotline ... Heck ... Even character development. Then, right in the middle of an MCU movie I found myself , well, feeling like I somehow landed in the middle of a Star Wars movie, cosplay, sets and all. This wasn't bad, maybe it was me, after all didn't Top Gun Maverick blatantly get away with ' blasting a mountain away' like they were destroying the Death Star ... Again! But, the Star Wars parallels kept on going all the way up to Kang and his Imperial Army. What finally got things right was how Kang was played by Jonathan Majors which, thank goodness, broke through as a true MCU villain. He was and truly is a worthy opponent to the Avengers and it is an extremely hard role to play. Not a pimp, or stree thug, but a complex presence in the Marvel Pantheon. This movie was hard to do in that it had the Loki storyline to expose at some time while introducing this particular 'he whose name is not to be spoken'. Threrin lay the rub: this had to be a cog movie, and NOT A PLATEAU OR PEAK! THERE'S MORE TO COME! GOOD STEPPING STONE MOVIE!!"
negative,"So I'd seen articles saying that hits film had received the lowest score for a marvel film, but was sure this couldn't be correct - after all, we've all seen Love and Thunder haven't we!So I went in with an open mind and upon finishing the film I was left with an unsure feeling about the film. Ant man is great character and I've enjoyed his films and appearances so far in the MCU, and all of these have been quite lighthearted, which makes me feel that the more I think about it, the more I feel that he is the wrong character to introduce the ""new big bad"" into the MCU. Don't get me wrong, given the setting I'm not sure who else could, but the tone of the film is more serious as a result of it, which doesn't seem to fit an Ant man film.It not without its good points of course, Paul Rudd is.... Paul Rudd, and that's never a bad things and he plays the plays the part great yet again, and some of the supporting cast are good also, Michael Douglas was bearable for a change, and I found Evangeline Lily to once again okay the Wasp well. Thee were some some action scenes in it and I found the CGI landscapes seemed to be visually stunning in places, and even though it maybe wasn't all great, to say this film was largely based on green screen, overall it was good.Unfortunately the film was let down by a few things, pacing being one of them as it is all over the place, which causes this to film to drag...a lot, especially in the middle section. There are also a few plot holes and issues that let the film down also. Many surrounding Janet:1. We were told she was alone in the quantum realm, yet she evidently spent years in there fighting a maniacal tyrant..... this never came up in conversation when she was home? Even when they decide to farm quantum particles at the end of the last ant man? Heads up might've been nice for Scott?2. If you're helping Cassie (who is apparently now also a technical genius???) build a machine to study the realm, maybe point out the dangers of it before she does something like this - don't tell her it's an empty realm then have a go at her for building it.3. When you're IN the realm and your family find out something is going on - tell them! None of this ""trust me"" ""there is no time"" crap!Also, I was under the impression, and could be wrong out this, that the suit protected the wearing when shrinking/enlarging, so I'm unsure why Scott and Cassie can take their helmets off, mid battle also, and it not affect them?Unfortunately for me, the main issues were the villains. M. O. D. O. K was never going to be an easy villain to show in live action - unfortunately some characters don't transfer well from page to screen, such as Galactus, so he was never going to look great, but it was the portrayal of him what was more annoying as, despite being feared as a hunter by the locals, he was purely played for laughs through the whole film. He was done better in the Avengers game! But for me the worst one was Kang! I guess the credits scenes show this character was somewhat of a red herring regarding being the ""next Thanos threat"", but this guy couldn't even lace his boots! At no point did we get any indication of his power or threat level, and gets beat rather easily by a regular human man who ""talks to ants"". I honestly expected some of the main cast to be killed in order to put across the threat level but no, everyone is fine - no trouble! Even after Scott and Hope seemingly get trapped in the quantum realm - oh hang on, let me just turn the machine back on... sorted!Also, the whole mulitiverse Kang situation doesn't entirely make much sense to me - so ""He who remains"" was worried of what would come if he got killed, which we all assume was this Kang we saw, who advises that he needs to get out of the realm and warned of what would happen if he didn't, but now he got killed, all the other variants, who banished him for trying to kill them all, decide now that Humans have killed him, they should kill the humans??? Huh?? What?? It really makes no sense?! To me, Kang would be better served just being the antagonist in the Loki series instead.So as always, it's sometimes easier to point out negatives than positives so it probably sounds like I hate this film, it's not perfect, but it's better than some of the more recent efforts."
negative,"If you've seen one MCU movie, you've seen this one as it does nothing more than check the same exact boxes every other MCU movie has checked for the last 10 years.Open with the hero being celebrated and trying to be normal? Check.Introduce a retconned back story for another character? Check.Try to inject humor that makes zero sense? Check.Try to have a badass moment that has zero build up? Check.Giant CGI battle where a bunch of characters that impacted the story in no way whatsoever are given 'dramatic' deaths? Check.Mcguffin that the heroes have to keep away from the bad guy? Check.Bad guy who has inconsistent powers? Check.New hero who spends the majority of the movie failing and learning how things work, but magically figures it all out in the big final battle? Check.Former villain returns, spends most of the movie still being a villain then randomly decides to be a good guy for no reason other than to needlessly sacrifice themselves and then get called an Avenger? Check.Deus ex machina that's set up early in the movie? Check.Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Jonathan Majors all look and act bored. Kathryn Newton does her best Kristen Stewart impression. Bill Murray is there to collect a paycheck, and he looks and acts bored as well.Honestly, don't waste your money or time on this movie."
positive,"I thought this flick was pretty cool. Id maybe go see it again. I like that it didnt get into Star Trek territory. Maybe I just liked it because there hasnt been any good movies out lately. I loved seeing what the villain was all about. Id rather immerse myself in this CGI world than Avatar. It has some different characters, giving us something other than superheroes and tech. If youre looking for something to trip out on, something like Aquaman, its freaking awesome. The realm feels like when Dr Strange fought Dormammu, which was an wicked scene. When i compare it to the other stuff out there like on TV Carnival Row, Picard, Moon Girl...Quantumania blows them out of the microshpere."
positive,"Considering last movie of ant man, i knew how antman indirectly effect teh marvel universe and this movie also stand there. Story begins with lite comedy scenes and it does not take more time to jump to get seriousness. Once that phase begins story goes in fast mode. One important thing that this movie carry about they give proper job for supporting characters but missed three buddies of Scoot. You know whom I talking about. VFX and CGI was good but not up to the mark. It may have improved if they have given time. Introduction of Daddy Kang was biggest responsibility that this carried out and I am satisfied with that. But movie took my heart in last post credit and I was like i wanted more in that scene. Over all I love this movie as always like antman first and second part does."
negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"

Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
positive,"We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that."
negative,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
positive,"I loved this movie, I think it's much better than Ant-Man 2. I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews, and I really don't understand the backlash. It was a fun, fast paced adventure with what I will call an ""ensemble"" cast that had the usual fun dialog along the way. Yes, there was a lot of CGI. Yes, there was a transitional cast aspect. No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans. As far as critics' reviews are concerned, I usually find the movies they applaud aren't that good, and movies they dislike are some of my favorites. In short, go see it and make up your own mind. You just might have a great viewing experience."
negative,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
negative,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
negative,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
positive,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
positive,"Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D."
positive,"Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word."
positive,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."

positive,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
negative,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
positive,"Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.
7/10."
positive,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
positive,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
positive,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
positive,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
positive,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
negative,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."
positive,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling. Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on. And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie.The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end. And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics. Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for. It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves. But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes. It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals using high end special effects and it had it's timely and spot on humor. This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
negative,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."
negative,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
negative,"""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
positive,"We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10."
positive,"I feel as if Kevin Feige likes to play connect four with characters in this universe. ""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no."
positive,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin."
positive,"Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!"
negative,"The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors."
positive,"I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story."
negative,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
negative,"Another serving of bland, bombastic superhero sludge from the mcu mcmovie factory. More annoying middle-aged hollywood vacuum tubes flying around on wires in gimpy clown suits. More obnoxious tweeny super geniuses snarking, pouting and virtue signaling their way through 2 hours of nonsense while all the ""adults"" stand around lavishing them with worship and praise. More bright n' shiny cgi strobing to distract the drooling screengazers from the total absence of a coherent plot or a single believable, compelling character. It's all just a big amorphous slurry of multiverses, timeloops and contrivances at this point. After 2 hours of the blathering dingbat Paul Rudd, his spoiled, mindwashed brat, and all the aneurism inducing cgi baffoonery - I'm done."
positive,"This is a great introduction to what Kang could really do for the future of the MCU. The movie starts off a bit slow with some jokes that feel forced. However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past. There were scenes that would leave you ""wow"" but also ones that are uneccesary.Overall the plot of the movie was just alright. This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU."
positive,"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure."
positive,"The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants."
negative,"This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme."
positive,"***Ant Man & the Wasp : Quantumania Movie Review ****Visually Splendid Experience... 🔥🔥🔥Scott Lang is back... This time he is on a mission to save his family from Kang: The Conqueror.Quantumania, Timeline, Kang Variants , Probability Storm & many more terminologies insights got from this movie...VFX i would personally view as Top Notch 🔥🔥Kang alias Jonathon Majors was outstanding. His small version was observed in Loki Season 1 but here he nailed the performance which i feel personally overshadowed the performance of Scott Lang & his team.2 Post credit scenes as always gives hopes to watch it's future Marvel Movies.Overall a visual treat experience movie which no doubt cannot afford to watch on a streaming platform."
positive,"This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating."
negative,Remember everything you loved about Ant man 1?Remember the heart pumping heist theme and the fun score that left you feeling pumped up and excited?Remember the trio of hillarious friends that Scott lang had and their antics?Remember the adorable chemistry between Scott and his daughter?Remember the menacing villain who made you feel uncomfortable and tense not knowing what was going to happen next?Remember when Marvel was a good franchise?Nah. Me neither.This movie has none of the stuff that made me like the first one (and even the second one to some extent)But what it does have is CGI.LOADS of it.What it does have is lots of yelling and screaming and shrinking and growing and bla bla bla boring empty spectacle.There's no heart here. No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis. Ittl take about 30 seconds and you'll have most of the details covered.
positive,"This MCU film is totally overhated without a reason... Firstly,the CGI were from another planet,the visuals were amazing...Also all the cast was great especially Jonathan Majors in the role of Kang the conqueror...He was terrifying.... He played Kang very well and in my opinion is better than Thanos...I am looking forward to see him in Loki season 2.... Furthermore the soundtrack was great and it fits perfectly to the epic final battle... Finally the two post credit scenes were awesome especially the first one with the council of Kangs.... Phase 5 MCU has began with the best way and is going to be peak...Be prepared for Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3."
positive,"A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!"
negative,"Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+."
positive,"'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending."
positive,"Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
positive,"The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather? Is Avatar the only franchise allowed to barf cgi at us with a mediocre script? Come on...Majors was great, the script was passable, and I laughed a ton. It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2. Curious to see how the timeline develops!"
positive,"""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project."
positive,"This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army."
negative,"Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat."
negative,"Positives: Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Paul Rudd are good and familiar. They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them."
positive,"At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2.."
positive,"I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies."
negative,"I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that."
positive,"I really enjoyed the first two movies, plot for the 3rd I really liked having visited the quantum realm besides Hope & Scott's Daughter Casey makes sense for it be be played out there.I loved the idea that the quantum realm has its eco system and it's own people and strange beings but it felt very Guardians of the galaxy but saying that set pieces were good and everyone putting in a good performance but Kang The Conqueror is meant to be the new big bad?Sadly not convinced, more of a pussy cat and very hard having seen how destructible Thanos was, was hoping for more!Other than that, enjoyed at most just not brilliant!"
positive,"This has been a usual marvel movie with all the commercial elements, a simple story with all techs and depth in that. The whole ant family has performed very well. It has fights talks etc. The usual ant man movie things with some humour to be kudos. It could have been different a bit but the movie has been reall usual nothing new. The one thing was kang , oh boy he is just master of conquerer. But such a strong villain been killed in a snap. But i hope something more to come in the future. Kang will return with bang. I am supporting a antogonist for the first time. Paul actually he is been a side stay, kang and janet being the main role played . But he just did justice to the role. It was entirely dominated by kang. As always a happy end to the movie. The main attraction in the post credit never miss it to watch it. Its really mindblowing, i dont want to spoil it. Please do watch it in theaters. A good start to phase 5."
positive,"First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential."
positive,"This was an enjoyable ride. There were glimpses, glimpses of that old Marvel magic at times, the humour, and a decent bad guy actually well used. But honestly Paul Rudd carries this film. He's the only actor who really shines, and eats up every scene he's in. The daughter and Kang are decent too.But it's good to watch a Marvel film without really any SJW nonsense. The focus on story and some jokes might be pushing Marvel back in the right direction (can only hope).The setting was unique and diffferent, but after a while it grated with the overuse of SciFi CGI. It's given me enough to want to see more Kang and maybe theres still life in the old Marvel yet."
positive,"People are acting like this movie is the latest Thor, it's not. It does have some silly moments. But there are plenty of intense moments as well. I went to go see this movie this afternoon and I finally felt like the MCU has hit its stride again. I feel like it's been awhile. I have not been a fan of the new marvel shows, I've honestly felt like they've been pretty lost. This is the first movie that has felt like the MCU is heading towards something, although it may not be the extract thing people guess. All I will say is that people need to give this movie a chance. I'm not a fanboy or a boy, I feel like a lot of the votes are from bots. It's a good movie and deserves a chance."
positive,Well all I can say is well And I thought that this film was very extraordinary And visually awesome however I am not the biggest Is aut_man fan But I am a massive Marvel fand I can tell you that this is my favorite Ant-Man In the trilogy even though The movie starts out a little bit slow but It gets better once all the characters go the Quantum realm and especially towards the end When You don't know if The villain of the film is dead or not I certainly think that if you Are a fan of This superhero Or Marvel Or big action Adventure films then this one is a good 1 to see I absolutely hope they make a 4 Is film And And can't wait to see what happens next I also Can't wait to watch the new Season of Loki.
negative,"This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!"
positive,"Best MCU movie since ""Spider-Mn: No Way Home!"" SO good and not to be missed. I cannot wait to see this movie again. Totally stands on its own, but is going to be the next chapter. SOOOOO good! The world-building is some of the best I've seen, very believable. So often, when movie create a totally new world, it is silly and doesn't make sense. Not in this case. And the inhabitants are far more than just actors in corny makeup. This is SO much better than Thor: Love and Thunder. Wonderful fleshing out of characters! Kang was amazing, acted wonderfully! I look forward to where the MCU goes next!!"
negative,"Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either."
negative,"I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor."
positive,"Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus."
positive,"It hasn't been a great last few outing for MARVEL and combined with the streaming shows, the Phase 4 didn't really hit the mark. With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best."
positive,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumanis is a good film and a good start to the MCU's Phase 5. Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10."
positive,"As another reviewer here has pointed out, this movie failed to introduce kang in its runtime and loki did it better in its finale. Kang the conqueror , is supposed to be an iconic villain and given the fact that he is played by majors , his story must be over the top. Kang has this power to freeze time and he uses that laser energy sorta thing . This guy freaki'n shattered timelines . There is no way scott will win. I want to see conqueror in action. This guy is the next villian of phase five and I cannot wait to look forward to it. Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies . But this movie proved I was wrong. Iam a marvel fanboy but even I am tired of this. It is obvious that marvel is hyping its audience for a future that will not come. GOTG 3 and loki season 2 are my only hope."
positive,"I was worried after hearing about initial mixed reviews and Quantumania being the second lowest scoring MCU film, but the critics were wrong - dead wrong. Quantumania is MCU's ode to Star Wars fun and it really works. The Ant-Man style of comedy is still there even though the stakes are much higher with the arrival of Kang the Conqueror who Jonathan Majors masterfully made the quintessence of intimidation and menace. Marvel made the best choice casting him as the next saga's big bad because his range, expression, and delivery are nonpareil. This guy is raw acting talent.A lot could have gone wrong with Quantumania. Like most of Phase 4, it could have gone too far and still have felt all for nothing. But it was the right amount of lunacy and imagination. The only stretch is MODOK. Yeah, everyone will no doubt agree the movie could've done without him and that he's undeniably the worst thing about the movie. Every scene he's in is so distracting and cringey. Only his last few ""brother"" and ""Avenger"" lines were tolerable - really funny actually. And while the script definitely suffered from spots of juvenile jests that I don't think even kids would find funny, all in all it still did a good job concisely giving backstories and delivering heart-felt moments between Scott and Cassie - the core characters of the story.Paul Rudd still rocks as Ant-Man. His comedic chops and timing always make him so entertaining to watch. Marvel can stop with his solo movies and throw him into every other film for buddy-com action and improve every movie. It would never get old.And I'll just say for the woke-watchers...there's no agenda of any sort in this movie. The swearing is even dialed back a lot especially compared to the last few MCU films. It's definitely more family entertainment."
positive,It wasn't as bad as people said. It was a decent film. Still Thor Love and Thunder is still goatedThis review was made on March 6 23About: The Ant family gets shrunk into the quantum realm. Jane has secrets. The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development. Everyone else was either just there or annoying/looked weird man . *cough* Cassie.When she said the D word to Modok it was so cringe funny.Overall the production and story went well. Way better than reviews stated.Highlight: I liked the possibility scene. Very creative.Quaz was good too. His queen reminded me of Rita. I liked her too. Kang too was iCONIC. Skrull Kang.Goofs: Cassie looked weird. I'm not sure why it was called Antman and Wasp. Wasp was very minor. She had no story.What can be learned? Secrets and Time are a dynamic duo.Should you watch this?: I say yes. Ignore the reviews and box office. Avatar 2 and 1 made a billion but those moves were not good. Antman 3 sets up a couple new events.
negative,"This is the worse written most nonsensical marvel movie, what a waste of 300 million, Paul Rudd seems like an extra in his own movie, Kang is easily defeated, dumb comedic tone, the quantum universe is poorly designed, the daughter is more powerful than modor, first time she uses the suit and she's a master, almost single handedly defeats Kang gimme a friking break, the way they handle the whole movie is a clear sign that the whole marvel universe is tired and should retire, they handle the whole quantum verse however is convenient to their badly written plot, just doesn't make sense at all, it's not even entertaining, cgi looks 20 years old, no emotion no climax no nothing, marvel you're done go home."
positive,"Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Quantamania is a typical marvel movie with grand visuals and a story that has pretty much nothing to offer.Katheryn Newtown seems like a good choice for Cassie lang. Let's hope she has more to offer in the future.As for the story,it gives us the first look at much anticipated Kang the Conqueror and Jonathan Majors has done a phenomenal job in potraying the big bad. But after all those build-ups and hype surrounding Kang as the big bad for this saga, i kinda felt they downplayed him in the movie. For someone as powerful as Kang to go down like that seemed like an injustice to the character.Overall, quantamania is a fun watch but is forgettable once you walk out the theatres. Jonathan Majors is the stand out of the film and am excited for what he holds in the future."
negative,"Trash beyond anything I could ever imagine. They should give refunds to everyone who went to see this garbage.The most unlikable characters the MCU has ever produced. The movie only has two types of characters: annoying girl-boss and annoying pathetic loser. These characters aren't relatable because these are the type of people you run away from on the street.Let's dump 300million into the CGI vomit machine and hope no one realizes how terrible the movie is. This is the grand strategy behind the geniuses at Marvel. It's sad and pathetic.I'm giving this a 1/10 because it has no value, and I left the theater in a worse state than I went in."
negative,"There's not much to say about the movie, to be honest. Every year, we've been watching a lot of average Marvel movies, series, and mini-series.The worst thing about this film was that it had a lot of problems showing Kang's power, especially in the scene where Ant-Man and Wasp fought him in the last scene, the cheesiness annoyed me.The acting, script, directorial skill, even the progress and handling of the revolutionary theme in the final scene, everything was very normal and ordinary. We've seen too many similar things in many works.The part I liked was the good visualization of the quantum dimension, which was very Star Wars themed. Especially the first scene with quantum was great in the cinema. Also, the adaptation of MODOK character to the cinematic universe was good, but his dialogues and death made me extremely sad because they were bad.In short, there was nothing extra in the movie, it was watchable but the forced joke attempts and poorly executed villain characters ruined the movie. Marvel needs to be more careful now, and realize that spending a lot of money doesn't make a good movie. I think the writers, especially in Phase 4, need to accept the fact that they are doing a bad job and choose a different path. Finally, I should add that the mid-credit scene was really bad, the voice changing was cringe-worthy. It's an average movie that can be watched."
positive,"Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichés, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution."
negative,"Take Marvels recent lacklustre offerings, add some Avatar visuals and the dialogue and acting of the last few Star Wars films, and you have this. It's cheesy, in the extreme. It's chock full of the usual tropes and character motivators that plague Marvel films. It feels like we are being force fed the same story, over and over, in all their films. Most of the characters are unlikeable, shallow and forgettable. I stopped caring about any of them about 20, yawn inducing, minutes in. This is not good film making. Loud colours, over the top character dynamics and a weak plot, do not give you a good film. I felt like I was watching garishly dressed, looking for laughs and attention, annoyances. Clowns, in other words. I felt like I was watching clowns. And that makes me so sad."
positive,"Quantimania is a strange a little movie. It tries to be an adventure movie, an Ant-Man movie and almost an avenger movie of sorts. There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang."
positive,"7 is well-deserved but wanted to give 8 just because I think 6.6 is not enough.Very good movie. No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful."
negative,"Scott Skywalker, Princess Hope, Obi-Wan Hank and Cassie-Rey face off against the villainous Darth Kang who has created a Multi-Verse Killer.Kang is being protected by Quantum Realm Troopers who guard his sky city against a group of resistance fighters looking to take back their planet.Overall a pretty good film. Not great, but not bad. It was Marvel without being overtly Marvel. Very thin, somewhat predictable plot without any surprises or twist. But some great visuals, some decent action sequences and a few good laughs.I saw the 3D version which was decent. No distracting gimmicks. Just some good added depth."
negative,"The MCU used to be something I would get excited about. While obviously not artistic masterpieces, the MCU used to be fun popcorn entertainment that would be a good way to take your family to the theater and be entertained by charming characters and fun action sequences. Now, it's a pale shadow of what it used to be and seems to only get butts in seats based on brand recognition alone.Pretty much everything I hated about phase 4 is on full display here. The writing is juvenile, the visual effects are atrocious, the humor is obnoxious, the ""emotional"" scenes don't work and all of the characters are hollow and uninteresting. Although I did enjoy the post credits scene and a couple of moments scattered throughout the film, I was begging for this one to just end as it is 2 hours long yet it felt like 4 hours.I'm so sick and tired of this franchise that I really want it to die. After Guardians 3, I might be tapping out completely."
positive,"This movie was not as bad as everyone is claiming. Is it of the same caliber as Lord of the Rings.... No. However, based on them having to make a movie about Antman and the Wasp, while at the same time having to set up the next phase of Marvel, I thought they did a great job. It was a fun movie and the visuals I thought were great.I thought the acting was great and the story moved along well. It was the first movie I've seen with Jonathan Majors and I thought he did an amazing job and I'm excited to check out some of his other acting credits.I went in to this with lower expectations because I haven't been wild about the new content from the MCU but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.I know some people were upset with how MODOK was portrayed but I thought they did a great job making him a fun addition. There is no way to make MODOK in a live action movie serious. So making him the butt of a joke was a great way to add him.I recommend giving this movie a shot."
positive,"The movie sets up the future of MCU but as an individual story it's not that great. The storyline is too obvious and no elements of suprise & twist. From acting point of view the movie looses its string on emotional pov, especially the father - daughter chemistry of Scott & Cassy. Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.Overall an one time watch. The movie has 2 post credit scenes and both are important for future."
negative,"MCU is dead. It is official. They can't produce any good movie anymore. It would be a safe bet to not watch their upcoming movies as they will involve this lethargic concept of multi-verse. How much of the same thing with the only difference of theme can people keep watching?About this movie, the story is meh, full of cliches, and the plot is quite predictable. It is nothing like the first ant-man movie.Animations are overdone, very flashy sometimes and not good for weak eyes. They aren't beautiful either.Only save here is the acting by senior actors.Verdict: save your money and time. Don't watch."
positive,"So this is rated about the same as Thor love and thunder? Really? Love and thunder was a bad film, this really isn't in the same league! I really enjoyed it, took it for what it was, some entertainment in a make believe world. Wasn't disappointed.Yes Marvel are churning out films like kids for child support.. doesn't mean they are all bad.. this seems to be the popular notion and go to criticism. Looking forward to seeing where the new story arc goes, hope they don't pull a love and thunder with the next Guardians film!In short, watch it, don't take it seriously and just enjoy it.. you won't be disappointed."
positive,"The movie is what it is; just for fun. Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun."
positive,"As a kid, I read and re-read Marvel Premiere #47, which showed how Scott Lang became Ant-Man. Written by David Michelinie and drawn by X-Men team of teams John Byrne and Terry Austin, it was a story I read and re-read and if you have ever seen the way I draw comic books, so much of it comes from this issue.So when it comes to that whole ""Are comics cinema?"" back and forth argument, I think you can figure out what side I'm on. Are there too many comic book movies? Were there too many giallo from 1970-1975? Did Italy make too many Westerns? Were there too many slashers in 1981? Can there be too much of something that you love?Alright, now that I have gotten past the legally required nod to serious criticism, let me tell you why I enjoyed this movie about humanoid broccoli.After the Avengers save everything from Thanos, former criminal and current Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled down from being Ant-Man, instead enjoying life as a writer, husband of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and father of Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), who is upset that her father isn't fighting for people any longer, instead enjoying the fruits of his hard work and resting on his laurels. There's a moment that's interesting here, as she discusses all the people who were displaced in the time where Thanos killed half of reality and now are homeless. Yes, it'd be great to explore this but this is a popcorn movie that soon moves past that; I'm not suggesting a popcorn movie delve into that, but hey, if there ends up being a Disney+ D-Man series that does, I'd watch that. Also, the fact that I just casually namedropped D-Man should explain why I never went to the prom.Anyways, Cassie has been working with her stepmother Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to communicate with the Quantum Realm, the place where Hank's wife Janey Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years of her life and has no interest in going back, particularly when it comes to explaining her past or unleashing new Marvel Cinematic Universe big bad Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, who is quite frankly amazing in this movie and brings a real sense of big drama to his role, not to mention all the various - oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING, I forgot that legal disclaimer -versions of Kang that he shows off, including Immortus, Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion and Victor Timely).Everyone soon gets pulled into that Quantum Realm and becomes part of the war between its inhabitants, with good rebels Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, who was already part of the MCU as Kimball in Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., as well as Major Sarah Grey in the DC superhero TV series Black Lightning and a comms officer on The Mandalorian; if you really want me to go full geek, she's a member of former Micronauts leader Commander Arcturus Rann's Enigma Force alongside other non-Mego owned characters Marionette and Bug; one more semicolon but man, this movie is as close as we're ever getting to a Michael Golden-era Micronauts movie), telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper; he's not Quasar, as many Marvel fans thought, but when he does pull a password out of someone's mind at one point, it's 18147, which would be Avengers #181, Scott Lang's first appearance, and a shout out to the aforementioned Marvel Premiere #47), the slime creature with no holes named Veb (David Dastmalchian, who was Kurt in the last two Ant-Man movies, Abra Kadabra on The Flash and Polka Dot Man in Suicide Squad), the flashlight head Xolum (James Cutler) and oh yeah, there's Bill Murray as Lando Calrissian (I kid, he's Lord Krylar, another of the characters like Jentorra who come from K'ai, the microplanet where the Hulk met one of the loves of his life Jarella) battling Kang and his Tron: Legacy-looking soldiers like he's Baron Karza or something.Anyways, yes, this all feels rather like Star Wars but then again isn't Star Wars influenced if not ripped off from Jack Kirby's Fourth World? Kirby invented most of the MCU and rebelling against a dark authority is pretty much an archetype. Where this gets kind of operatic is that Ant-Man is, well, an ant against space god Kang and that's a battle that I never saw coming.I also never thought I'd see MODOK (Machine Organism Designed Only for Killing) in a movie, much less one that fully embraces the absolutely goofy idea of a giant head in a chair with weapons and baby legs. Also, this ends up being former Yellowjacket Darren Cross from the first movie and every time his real face shows up, it breaks the movie but it's a welcome break in the movie.You can imagine - and you'd be right - that the good guys win but this movie brings up an interesting idea that you can't just punch Kang, who lives his life across multiple timelines that are not linear and that this Kang may not be the worst of the many Kangs. Then Scott brushes it off and tries to enjoy some Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake (the fact that the ice cream chain has no tie-in flavor and yet had a Condorman flavor back in the 80s is kind of upsetting).In the same way that politics - nice socialism shoutout with the ants in this - just leads to people not listening to one another, a lot of folks have their minds made up about comic book movies which are really just mythology and should be seen as such. That said, this movie did what all popcorn films should: it entertained me. I think it's hilarious that one of the film's writers, Jeff Loveness, said that this movie is ""Jodorowsky's Dune within Marvel"" and there are not enough drugs in the world to show you what Alejandro Jodorowsky would do with a Marvel film but hey, he also did The Incal in comics form, so when you denigrate comics, keep in mind that a hero of cinema spent so much of his time there.I explained to my wife tonight that as a kid, there I never really wanted to get involved in human drama or how stressful some extended family members could be, so I just filled my life with comic books. Often when we talk on the phone, my mom will say, ""Do you remember this person,"" and the answer is no, I do not remember this person. However, if she asked, ""Was Wolverine really in World War 2?"" I could give her several anecdotes and explain how Black Widow could be young and yet still saved by Logan and Captain America in 1941.So yeah, I liked this movie."
positive,"Just finished watching the movie at the cinema and it was really awesome. Great fun and a lot of sci fi. Yes, it wasn't a grand plot like end-game. But still very entertaining and packed. Movie was clean and story was good. Plus it ties to the next phase of marvel movies. I assume low reviews are because people were comparing it to some great ones as the story could have been better and perhaps some might think it's a little random. But for those who are not so attached to the perfect marvel story. It's great. I would definitely give it a go. I watched it in 3D and CGI and effects were also pretty good. There are 2 credit scenes. Enjoy :)"
positive,"Aa a solo movie ye ek acchi movie hai...
Acchi comedy+ badiya action seen hai...Kang the conqueror 🔥🤙 like ek baap level villen ki filling deta he ye banda .End fight.... Kang v/s Lang are amazing 😍It is best antman movie in terms of action.This film have two post credit scene
Both are good 👍
My personal favourite post credit scene are mid-credit scene in which we see counsel of Kang..... it's a amezing seen😊Overall dekhe to achhi movie hai...
I don't know log iss movie ko hate kyu de rahe hai...i think log endgame & infinity war se compare kar rahe hai iss liye hate kar he...
But hamko iss picture ko as a solo movie Leni chahiye....it is a good movie i give 9/10👍😊"
positive,"We go down into the quantum world and enter planet cgi. Apart from the actors everything is CGI. There are strange creatures and landscapes. There are people who for the most part are similar to human, body, 2 arms, 2 legs etc. But with various different heads. There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.The plot is acceptable and the villain is great. He's definitely menacing. They're so confident of him they say he'll be back.So enjoy. Ant-man and the wasp will win but they left a let out for a sequel."
negative,"With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
positive,"This movie was great. The cgi gave me a little bit of a headache but not a migraine or anything. Also this movie is more serious instead of funny. They have jokes in the movie every now and then, but not so much. I don't really like how they handled
M. O. D. O. K. But he was funny and has an exciting return from a previous character. Kang is really scary and disturbing. There is two bonus scenes in total. One of them is a great way to show the future of the multiverse saga and the second one made me jump out of my seat because I was so happy. This film was a great way to open up phase five.8/10."
positive,"Jonathan Majors performance as 'Kang The Conqueror' is praise worthy, he delivers it with great intensity. Kang chaos is kicked off for the 'Multiverse Saga', with this entry movie of MCU Phase 5. Entertainment is filled with humorous comedy and action that MCU delivers as always. Adventure of quantum realm with good screen time is key to this movie, and you will love to see good family drama enhanced. Lower your expectation and enjoy this movie in 3D, I don't understand why is this movie getting such rotten reviews. Wait until last before getting of your seats, those two P. C. S . Is awesome, it won't let you disappoint."
negative,"Where do you start with Quantumania?It's an absolute mess of a movie and the demise of the Marvel Universe speeds up.The biggest threat to the multiverse and beyond isn't Kang or Thanos or Dr. Doom or whoever.It's the writing committees that have pretty much written everything since End Game.It's been downhill since then with a few decent moments in between.Quantumania is terrible. Wait for it to show on Disney if you must. Or, you could do yourself a favour and give it a wide berth. It has none of the charm of the previous two films and absolute zero jeopardy.There is nothing on the line because Kang can jump back and forward through time through multiple personalities. So nothing matters."
positive,"The third movie was totally different than the previous movies. It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang. We get to see a throwback segment and find out more about Kang and Janet's time when she vanished into the quantum level."
negative,"Ant-Man's third installment in the MCU the start of the great phase 5 woohoo!! Bringing in the with bang Kang the next big baddie in MCU after Thanos, or did they??....For some reason even after a very bad 2nd movie I was excited to see this 3rd installment and see how the character of Kang would be portrayed in the movie, but after watching it while the performance of Jonathan majors was standout, I was left underwhelmed. Its just another Marvel movie with a lot of shortcomings in the storyline. The plot felt uninspired just like the previous one without bringing anything new to the table.The Movie in its core the movie lacks proper development even though the movie had some beautiful visual effects they only feel to serve as distraction from the weak plot. Its basically all just CG other than maybe the faces of some at times .If you are also someone who used to love Marvel and was hoping that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania would get the MCU back on track after several disappointing entries and you can safely avoid to go out of your way to watch this. 6 is for real generous for this."
negative,"Negatives: No Michael Peña/Luis (in a freaking Ant Man movie which he's always in), ridiculous scenes and dialogue that seemed to be written by children (I trusted you, you gave your word when he didn't know Kang at all, etc), MODOK and how dumb he was/looked and his character's lines (he did not need to be in the movie), and then playing the pronoun game earlier in the movie way too much and how they kept saying ""him, he"" etc talking about Kang just to build tension which got annoying at a certain point.Positives: Kang was a cool and powerful villain and Jonathan Majors acted very well and I can't wait to see him in Creed 3, Paul Rudd did well as Scott Lang as always and his humor worked, and the world building and effects/green screen looked really good and it was creative what they did with the quantum realm.Overall it wasn't a bad movie, the story was good but it had parts that made me cringe pretty hard. I'd much rather rewatch the first one or second one (which are more original and funnier)."
negative,"I didnt hate this movie since Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas were really good and made it worth the watch. Paul Rudd ruins it IMO and I can hardly stand him and will never understand why they chose him to play a super hero in the first place. I loved the world building in this movie. The wife, Evaneline Lilly? Has no business playing Michelle Pfeiffers daughter, she looked the same age or just a few years younger. Who cast Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother? She looked great IMO and was just awesome. I'm truly tired of these Marvel movies, but since not much else is being made, and I thought this one would be interesting, I went to see it. Its better than nothing, so I gave it 6 stars. The actor playing the bad guy was great too."
positive,"Surprise! I really enjoyed this movie, which was surprising as it seems to be getting lambasted by critics and audiences alike. And on one hand, I can understand; people are getting superhero fatigue, and Ant-Man never was the most popular character out there. On the other hand, this third entry in the ""Ant-Man"" series of films is a science-fiction adventure that I, for one, couldn't get enough of.If you're a fan of straight up sci-fi, I honestly can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this movie; virtually from beginning to end, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an exercise in engaging world building and incredible visuals - on a purely visual aspect this movie is a 10 out of 10; the movie takes viewers through a world - a universe - that is so interesting to look at that I found myself almost jaw-dropped for 90% of this film's runtime. But of course, great visuals can only take a movie so far.Luckily, ""Quantumania"" delivers on pretty much every other aspect as well. With fantastic chemistry between its main characters, the film is a sheer delight to watch in terms of characterization and character interaction. Paul Rudd is charismatic as usual, but I was even more impressed with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton; you'd think the ridiculous subject matter would lead to ridiculous performances, but they're all bringing their A-game here, which was unexpected but appreciated. Now I know what you're thinking: ""How was Jonathan Majors?"" Let's talk about it.Introducing a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania"" is apparently setting up the next biggest Marvel baddie. And while I found Kang to have a lot of potential, I wasn't particularly impressed with his villainy here, as much as I enjoyed Majors in the role. While Majors adds a cold menace to the character, I found a lot of Kang's dialogue to be trite and evil for the sake of being evil. While his initial introduction is more nuanced, the film foregoes that, and instead makes the character extremely one dimensional. That said, I did feel as if he was a worthy enough opponent in this movie, and I am interested to see the future development of this character.If you're going to see an MCU movie, you most likely care about the action; while ""Quantumania"" didn't have a ton of action in it (the movie focuses more on adventure than action), the action it did have satisfied me. While the action is extremely CGI heavy for the most part, I found it exciting in its sci-fi centricity - it really felt like I was watching a ""Star Trek"" movie, and while some people may not like that, I absolutely loved it.Overall, I had a fantastic time with this movie. Audiences seem to be turning on Ant-Man and on the MCU in general, but I found this to be a refreshing take on the genre with its emphasis on pure science-fiction adventure. You may not enjoy this as much as I did, but if you're a Marvel fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch."
positive,"One of the most fun and weird movies I've seen in a while, which is mostly a compliment. I liked it! It was fun! I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of creatively new designs the quantum realm yielded, the probability storm scene in particular was one of my favorite MCU movie sequences of the past couple years. It really felt like a colorful comic book come to life. The blobby guy was a scene-stealer, though obviously he didn't reach the sheer comedic prowess of Luis, who was missed here. The Pym-Lang family were a great cast of characters to watch and even if the other 2 Ant-Man films may be the better two because of the tonal difference, it was still interesting to see them face a larger-scale threat, and the final battle of the civilians and the heroes versus Kang's army felt very tense and exciting....where has Jonathan Majors been the past decade?? This man can act like nobody's business. Kang was easily one of the best parts of the movie, his backstory with Janet was really intriguing and his unrelenting coldness in his methods was chilling, as was his massive displays of power. It'll be awesome to see him again down the road. MODOK was cool and funny, until his mask came off and I felt as though someone had poured sodium chloride into my eyeballs. Bill Murray was good but underused. I wished there was a little more time spent in San Fransisco (Jimmy Woo!) it felt like we had just barely re-established the characters before they were thrown into the quantum realm. Also, the second trailer for this movie made it seem as though Kang was going to tempt Scott with helping him regain time with Cassie that he lost over the blip, with dialogue that I'm pretty sure wasn't in the Final Cut discussing it (Kang even tells Janet at one point that he could send her back before she ever left her own family). I'm surprised they didn't go this route in the movie, instead having Kang's end of the bargain only being to not kill all of them. Overall though, the movie was really fun, weird, and visually pleasing, and a great time at the movies. The stakes felt higher than most MCU movies since we know Kang is going to be the next big villain and it felt like anything could happen with the timeline.Now, my opinion on the MCU movie prejudice that seems to be growing and growing: People keep dissing on these movies because they're not as 'refined' or something as other movies out there, but It's unfair to compare completely different genres with each other. People that want to say the MCU is too ""VFX heavy"" or ""Unserious"" need to realize that that's exactly what these types of movies are here to provide for audiences: a colorful, funny, adventurous story filled with superpowered heroes that fight evil. And audiences eat it up every time, it's clear that MCU movies are connecting with the general moviegoing public because every single release is a hit (some smaller than others, but still successful) and people keep coming back for more. Those who want to take shots at the aspects of MCU movies that are integral parts of MCU movies should just watch something else. I completely understand disliking these movies if one thinks they contain weaker superhero stories or weaker VFX or weaker comedy than usual, but one can't complain about it the existence of these different aspects in general when they're just pillars of what makes an MCU movie that people keep on coming back to for more. Sure, Quantumania wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a perfectly satisfying and fun romp through a superhero-filled world, which is exactly what I expected from it. If I wanted a movie without these aspects, I wouldn't watch it. Hope that made sense, and here's to more fun MCU outings.*exhales* but anyways, cool film. OWEN WILSON!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Man, this product has no reason to exists.Most of it is just talking in 3 locations. Half or it is just talking in 3 locations.The CGI gets boring very quickly. This is effectively an aminated product.The Wasp saved this product, while the old lady is in there the most and dictates this product. Makes me wonder, why it is considered an ""Antman"" product.Deus-Ex-Ant-Machina. They just pull it out of thin air and it makes no sense.Kang is insanely boring. All he can is building B-Level storm troopers. And shoot laser that vaporizes people.The Stormtroopers did nothing. They lost against guys with swords.The ""Massage"" of capitalism bad and socialism good is insulting. The makers clearly never seen what happened to the ideologies when millions of people were killed and had to suffer for ""utopia""."
positive,"After reading some reviews, I thought it's going to be terrible and was expecting disappoint. However, it was actually decent movie. J Major did a awesome job playing Kang. Also if you've watched Loki season 1 on Disney then you'll understand the story line much better. I do feel like they could have taken a bigger risk with the story line. There are two end credit scene, I believe it was worth it staying for the first end credit scene but not the last end credit scene. All it did was setup a Disney plus series.My final advise would be to rewatch Loki season 1 before going to watch quantanmania."
negative,"""Phase Five"", ""Kang the conqueror"", ""multiverse"" --- it all sounds so monumental, but looks so tottering.Great visual effect (shout out to the VFX workers), as illustrated in a motley of scenic, architectural, and environmental designs; especially the long shot of the flight sequence, which captures the flamboyant otherworldliness of quantum realm. Action wise, the movie presents a short yet meticulous combat scene between Kang and the Ant-family, displaying tacit combos and fluent choreography. Moreover, giant Ant-Man demolishing the citadels is quite similar to AOT, and the way Kang suspends the hurtling cane gives me Kylo Ren vibes, not to mention the quantum species are really comparable to the aliens of Star Wars, which are all nice little allusions in my opinion but could be a sign of Marvel's creativity fatigue. And here goes the negatives.I'm sorry, but Cassie's actress is terrible at portraying her character, showing no emotions facially or within the eyes when her father falls off a cliff or gets beaten to death by the villain, which contrasts farcically to her anxious voice. Introducing terrible ""New Avengers"" is hereditary as we've seen in Phase Four (Iron Heart, Kate Bishop, America), which is why Stinger is even more frustrating and illogical of a character: unreasonably caring, doted by her family, and excuse me incited a local rebellion as a two-day visitor? Speaking of which, the rebels demonstrate so potent a motive with so little characterization, as they seem even less important to the plot development that actual ants. And speaking of ants, how in the flabbergasted-ness do ants overpower the timeline-shattering Thor-killing multiverse-conquering Kang? I understand how Jonathan Majors is grinding to perform this so-called ""ultimate antagonist"" of Phase Five and Six with contorted facial expressions and balefully imperious tone, yet Kang's failure in the film simply makes this villain far less menacing. Though titled ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", the movie leaves no room for Scott (I'm sorry Paul you tried) or Hope (basically Black Widow but only the stingers) to literally and figuratively ""grow"" as main characters. Michelle and Michael's chemistry is the only landing ground for comedy (oh yeah the jokes suck btw); though in terms of between-character scenes, I loved the backstory of Janet and Kang, as their brief interaction exhibits a mother's yearning and a warrior's sympathy with pure dialogues and micro-expressions, which in turn deepens the duo's contradiction.If this was a film of Phase Four, I'd let it slide with a 7/10. However, we're in a new Phase with new expectations, and the customers will not be satiated with Marvel serving the same meal as before."
negative,"What the hell did I just watch? And the answer is: a movie written by 3rd graders with cognitive issues.This movie was so basic, so annoying most of the time I had to go for bathroom breaks around 6 times. Jesus, what a waste. A movie made to scratch egos of lesser directors and actors.Full of politics and propaganda and not enough action. Ant man gets a backseat in his own movie. What the hell MCU? Or should I say MSHEU. Teenage girl that creates complex machinery in her bedroom? Seriously? Its like it was written by the writing team of She Hulk.Hot garbage and nothing else. Not even mildly entertaining, unless you've never seen a movie in your life."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is the third installment in the Ant-Man franchise and the first film in Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as they explore the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dimension where they encounter strange creatures and a powerful villain named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).The film has a lot of visual spectacle and creativity, as it showcases the wonders and dangers of the Quantum Realm. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining, especially when Ant-Man and Wasp use their shrinking and growing abilities to fight their enemies. The film also introduces some new characters, such as Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter who becomes a political activist, and Jentorra (Katy O'Brian), a Mandalorian-like warrior who helps them in their quest.However, the film also suffers from some flaws that prevent it from being a great movie. The plot is convoluted and messy, as it tries to juggle too many elements and subplots without giving them enough development or coherence. The film also lacks the humor and charm that made the previous Ant-Man movies so enjoyable, as it takes itself too seriously and loses some of the fun factor. The film also makes some tonal departures from the earlier films, as it deals with darker themes such as trauma, guilt, and genocide.The most disappointing aspect of the film is Kang the Conqueror, who is supposed to be the new main antagonist of the MCU. While Jonathan Majors gives a good performance, his character is poorly written and underdeveloped. He is introduced too abruptly and without much explanation or motivation, making him seem like a generic and bland villain. He also does not pose much of a threat to Ant-Man and Wasp, as they easily defeat him in the end.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some positive aspects, such as the visual effects, the action scenes, and some of the performances, but it also has some negative aspects, such as the plot, the screenplay, and Kang the Conqueror. It is not a terrible movie, but it is not a great one either. It is a mediocre movie that could have been much better."
negative,"The introduction into the Quantum realm really gave me Star Wars vibes and I would say that's a good thing. The character designs were great. The plot and backstory for why things were happening was explained well and easy to follow. All the characters from the previous films played their roles well.As far as new characters, Kang was excellent. Though he didn't show off too much of his powers. I wasn't expecting him to so I wasn't disappointed. I would say towards the end, the film did make him seem a bit weak. Great character played by a great actor nonetheless.Modok could have been better. His initial look was fine but once his true identity was revealed that's when he looked weird. They could have done with working on that CGI or not show that version of him that many times once they showed who he truly was. He was used too much for comedic relief and towards the end it was a bit much.The action in the film was entertaining but nothing over the top.The dialogue and forced comedy towards the end is what brings this movie down a bit. There were bits of dialogue/scenes that could have been taken out and the film would have been much stronger. Specifically from Modok and Ant-man's daughter and like one line from Kang.Overall it was another entertaining Ant-man movie that didn't disappoint. Don't believe the Critics, enjoy the film."
negative,"AMWQ is a good movie, full of exciting special effects, a powerful bad guy, lots of action and a spattering of comedy mixed in. Unfortunately, it stuck to the same cookie-cutter format that the MCU has been relying on, post EndgameI guess that could be considered good or bad news, depending on what you like to see. But I will say this, watching MCU movies as of late is like eating pizza everyday for, like, a couple of weeks straight. Love pizza, but too much of a good thing is never a good thing. I'm still waiting for something in these new Phases of the MCU to move me like I was moved in the early years of the MCU. Sadly, AMWQ doesn't do anything for me.I still don't know why Infinity War and Endgame seemed so damned good. I guess Infinity War and, to an extent, Endgame had more humanity to it. Those movies had character growth, more emotional interaction, more substance to who the actual players were and how they tied into the plots. Those movies surely had better quality writing, and the acting, as I remember it, was also much better than what I've seen in recent MCU movies. What I've noticed is that the MCU is trading quality scriptwriting for CGI, and the narratives are now focused on female heroes, and genius children/teen, whom also tend to be MENSA level scientist and inventors. I'm not stating that those people don't exists, but it's being overdone, almost forced on us (remember the pizza analogy).Couple this with some very poor writing (the way MODOK was challenged to conversion via a flurry of ""d*ck"" references was disgusting and cheap).So, yeah, Ant-Man/Quantomania is a good enough movie. It was fun to watch, and it will make money. I guess all these MCU movies will make money until they don't...which probably means people are finally getting sick of pizza.6/10 fun, but nothing unique here."
positive,"Antman and the wasp:quantumaniaI have a big hope for this movie due to it achievements from the previous movie.i got from ear to ear that this movie have a lot of action coming but here is the thing,it got 6.5 IMDB and 47 %in rotten tomato. I have a mix reaction for this movie.to Find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. Without further rido,so sit back tight and enjoy my review for this movie:-this is a slow pace movie and a pinch of comedic natural.-the cinematography in this movie is pretty decent and above average for marvel studious(bruh)
-this movie has also has a family moral and I suggest to watch this movie with your family.-i think I would suggest you watch the guardian of galaxy and the previous movie to totally understand the flow of the movie.-well quantum exist in real life but scientists could never implement it.so sad.-as the typical marvel movie well someone would recommend not to do it but someone eager to do it and all of them is in trouble.( Yeah, I know ,pretty typical)
-the graphic is magnificent and above average.i think marvel actually learn from the previous movie (if you know what I'm saying).-it has a pretty strict conflict between the family.this movie has a lot of comedic in it to crunch my soreness in this movie-i would say this movie is pretty adventurous and has many things going on
it has a backstory from jannet that you need to focus in this movie-the action was one of the best in my carrier.the camera angle and many thing is scripted perfectly.-the ending is pretty decent and it's just it you know what I meantRating:
Plot:7/10
Pacing: 6/10
Cinematography:9/10
Characters: 8/10
Actor:10/10
Affects:7/10
Overall:8.5/10."
positive,"The first two Ant Man movies the quantum realm was talked about, but in Quantumania we now see it first hand. Scott and family find themselves pulled into the quantum realm, only to discover it's also another universe, and Janets past quickly comes back to haunt her.Jonathan Majors really blew me away has the villian Kang, givin a type Darth Vader like performance, even with his calmness you clearly see the insanity in him. Paul Rudd once again brings likable comic charm, Michael Douglas was good, so was Evanegline Lilly and Michelle Pfieffer. Sometimes Kathryn Newton was annoying , but other times she was good. The effects are awesome, I love the star wars like adventure."
positive,"I don't write reviews for movies very often. I feel compelled to do so for this new because of four things: I'm a MCU fan, I enjoy movies, I want Marvel Studios to keep entertaining us with great quality stories, and I am very concerned now with what I've seen with the last few movies. This one is no exception.Don't get me wrong. There is a lot to love about this film. I found the strange world of the quantum realm very imaginative and vast. I like what's going on with the story centering on the Pym & Lang families. I even love the moments with Jonathan Majors's Kang.But... there were too many plot holes, pointless scenes, and certain characters this movie REALLY did not need. Especially in the third act with the big battle when the real action finally picked up. Too bad. I really wanted to love this film."
negative,"It started off well. The bits set in the real world have humour and character.Then they go to the quantum realm and it falls apart. The vast majority of the film is CGI. Endless CGI. Too much CGI. Seen it all before.We are expected to care about a war happening in the quantum realm between two factions its hard to care about. We are told which side we should root for.Then at the end we are told we might have rooted for the wrong side - it might not be as simple as we thought.Then in true Marvel style something weird happens that has you questioning everything, including whether its worth it at all as they can now throw away all rules required for something to be realistic and have something we can root for, and do what they like.Paul Rudd can't save it, watchable as he is.Michelle Pfeiffer is miscast.Michael Douglas is under used, restricted largely to comic relief.The whole film is started by the actions of three characters who should know better, and if they behaved as they would in reality would never have carried out the actions that cause them all to be sucked into the quantum realm. Of course they shouldn't have been messing with what they were messing with... (Makes it even less believable).Might have worked better at 90 minutes - the length such movies used to - and should - be."
positive,"So I actually really enjoyed this movie it was a lot of fun. It was funny, it was very interesting, I like how they're building up the story and yet it's not going to be some huge monumental thing like Infinity War but if you just watch it for what it is it really is a great movie. The action was great I do think that it would be cool to have a little bit more of Kangs power shown but he was still awesome in the movie itself. If you get a chance definitely watch the Loki show it ties in with it a little bit. Stop putting movies on such a pedestal to be 10 at a tens just watch it for what they are and you'll enjoy them a lot more. I can't wait to see how much more kangs character evolves in the upcoming movies."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania:Take me back to reality please! Ant-Man and the Wasp find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible.The third installment of the Ant-Man trilogy doesn't feel like an Ant-Man movie at all. Scott Lang was anything but the main character in the movie. I would've preferred if the Ant-Man was the main focus of the movie. Another problem I had with the movie was that it was all set in the quantam realm meaning that everything you see is CGI and fake. It looked cool at the first glance but as the movie progressed, it started to become more and more annoying. Just show me something real please! Additionally, the CGI and green screen weren't really that good. I could see Paul Rudd's outline in some scenes. Also, the acting of some of the cast was pretty bad especially with the very basic dialogue.Kang just stole the show. His backstory was very well written and his character had so much depth. His fight scenes with Ant-Man were so good and entertaining to watch. Jonathan Majors as Kang maybe one of the best villains in the MCU and I'm very glad he'll be sticking with us for a long while. The movie had it's funny bits but some jokes weren't really that funny.Score:6/10."
negative,"Where do I even start with this boring, exposition-drenched Star Wars wannabe?I guess I'll start at when I knew the movie was going to be trash. At the beginning of the movie, Ant-Man has to go down to the local police station to pick up his daughter from jail. She was arrested because the police were tasked with clearing out a homeless encampment (in reality, encampments are a serious crime issue on the West coast), but Ant-Man's daughter didn't like that, so she destroyed police equipment. The next scene at dinner, Hank Pym said he would've marched in there and broken her out of jail. Why is Marvel pushing anti-policing/anti-justice and having a teenage girl as their ""martyr"" or spokesperson or whatever. Shouldn't the Marvel heroes be working together with the police to stop crime? What is this leftist gibberish? I have grown to expect this from Marvel after the Disney acquisition, but man were the politics extra loud in this movie.Regardless of the extreme leftist political pandering written by someone who is completely detached from actual society and the real world being forced onto us, the movie was still trash. Kang was an absolute joke of a villain in this movie. I have no idea how they plan(ned) on making him the new big bad, someone on Thanos's level after what I just saw. The action was so boring and drab because you know everyone's going to be fine. There's no sense of danger or risk that something won't go as planned. So many scenes and sets were just blatantly ripped from A New Hope it's honestly pathetic.I know Disney owns Marvel and Star Wars, but keep them separate. Let them have their own feel to them, like back when the first Avengers came out. That movie had its own unique feel/aura and has aged extremely well. Marvel movies are now too busy pandering to politics to tell an interesting story with real fleshed out characters dealing with serious issues that have consequences. It feels like every Marvel movie is trying to be Thor Ragnarok now, and that only spells disaster.I'm more sad than mad. I thought this movie looked decent from the trailers too. After this, I don't think the days of actual quality films like Iron Man or Avengers are coming back, not from Disney.The most criminal thing about this movie is they somehow even made Paul Rudd unlikable.2/10."
negative,"Pretty average, it feels like a lot of movie tropes slapped together. There were some good moments but everything was really reduced to a punchline in the end (Kinda like Love & Thunder). There were some emotional tones but nothing really sticks together. Doesn't help that everything except the main cast faces is extremely obvious CGI. Not much room for disbelief to be suspended. I did like the villains for the most part, Kang is definitely not a Thanos (yet), but he has the right tone and I like that he is considerably different from Thanos. The rest of the characters are just kinda rediculous and the Quantum Realm is apparently just a big Star Wars cantina. I was happy surprised with MODOK, except it just end with him being essentially a joke, like many good things in this film."
positive,"I am a marvel fan. Iron man to ant man the wasp all movie i watched. Every marvel movies are very good. But now a days i dont feel like those 2010-2020 years movies of marvel. Avangers movies are another level entertainment. But this movie also good. Movie like iron man, captain america,, avangers infinity war i watched them 3-4 times. Thats movies are attractive for me. But nowadays some marvel movies like antman not have old marvel movies vipes. A man who never watched marvel movies,, this movie are very very enjoying movie for him. But a marvel fan alltime wants avengers types movies where every marvel superhero fight to save the planet."
positive,"Caught an advanced screening of this tonight & despite the negative reviews I had read this was pleasantly surprising for me. The blend of action, storytelling & comedy was much better balanced than recent Marvel films, the visual effects were beautiful, also much better than recent additions. I did enjoy the first two Ant-Man's better than this one but found this one was most definitely worth a trip to the cinema. Kathryn Newton very well casted for Cassie & adds well to the movie. Some moments with Scott were really beautifully done along with some humour, especially early on. Cassie's admiration for Jentorra was really cool & the 'just stop being a dick' to Darren (who returns in a funny way) was brilliant. Loved Paul Rudd's delivery of this line:
Kang: You're not the one with the hammer?Scott: That's Thor. We get confused a lot. Similar body types.Overall this movie is better than a lot of recent marvel films but not as good as the franchise once was. There are two credit scenes, one near the start of the credits & one right at the end."
positive,"I have had the privilege and fortune to be able to watch it on opening day in 3D. I personally mostly enjoyed it, but I found some flaws with it.Let's get to the positives first. Majors was genuinely threatening and scary as Kang, his gravitas being genuinely scary and chilling for the entire multiverse. He has managed to be a legitimate contender to Thanos' throne as MCU's biggest villain yet. Another positive I can note is the humor. Now, I did not laugh out loud at every single joke that the film had to offer, but its heart was mostly genuine, and some of it did land. (MODOK's appearance was ironically pretty funny to me, the CGI monstrosity was... something.)Now let me get to the negatives. If it weren't for the fact I watched it in 3D, I think it would be obvious most of the time that they are on a green screen in a CGI world. The creatures in the Quantum Realm were mostly uninspired. It was clear they had taken references from other sources and... eh. It kinda looked busy.The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he lives his life in San Francisco. It all starts off normally until his daughter, Cassie, gets freed from prison after she was in some sort of protest or whatever? Then they go to Hank's lab or something and they discover that they can communicate with the Quantum Realm. That machine goes wrong and they get transported into the Quantum Realm. They find their way in, learn a bunch of customs and, after drinking some slime, can communicate with whatever creatures there are in this realm.Then at some point, Ant-Man, Hope, Hank, Cassie and all the others get separated, things go on, Bill Murray appears and is freaking cool, at some point there comes Kang, some more things happen, then it really begins to end when Ant-Man, Hope and Cassie stand alongside Kang, and Kang says ""I conquer worlds, you talk with ants"" and Hank just comes with a CGI army of ants to save the day, and then they're in some tower and the little guy has to sacrifice, then it's kinda bittersweet.Fine plot, it works, it was entertaining, but honestly I liked what 3D could bring to me and my favorite part was when the screen went dark and he got into the nucleum and there was the Storm of Possibilities, pretty cool CGI. Entertaining, good as an introduction to Kang, but not much else. Could have been a lot better."
positive,"Sometimes a movie over sells itself with all the previews and such so that your expectations are based on what you thought you would see. The first 30 minutes therefore thrilled me with its humor and unfolding plotline ... Heck ... Even character development. Then, right in the middle of an MCU movie I found myself , well, feeling like I somehow landed in the middle of a Star Wars movie, cosplay, sets and all. This wasn't bad, maybe it was me, after all didn't Top Gun Maverick blatantly get away with ' blasting a mountain away' like they were destroying the Death Star ... Again! But, the Star Wars parallels kept on going all the way up to Kang and his Imperial Army. What finally got things right was how Kang was played by Jonathan Majors which, thank goodness, broke through as a true MCU villain. He was and truly is a worthy opponent to the Avengers and it is an extremely hard role to play. Not a pimp, or stree thug, but a complex presence in the Marvel Pantheon. This movie was hard to do in that it had the Loki storyline to expose at some time while introducing this particular 'he whose name is not to be spoken'. Threrin lay the rub: this had to be a cog movie, and NOT A PLATEAU OR PEAK! THERE'S MORE TO COME! GOOD STEPPING STONE MOVIE!!"
negative,"So I'd seen articles saying that hits film had received the lowest score for a marvel film, but was sure this couldn't be correct - after all, we've all seen Love and Thunder haven't we!So I went in with an open mind and upon finishing the film I was left with an unsure feeling about the film. Ant man is great character and I've enjoyed his films and appearances so far in the MCU, and all of these have been quite lighthearted, which makes me feel that the more I think about it, the more I feel that he is the wrong character to introduce the ""new big bad"" into the MCU. Don't get me wrong, given the setting I'm not sure who else could, but the tone of the film is more serious as a result of it, which doesn't seem to fit an Ant man film.It not without its good points of course, Paul Rudd is.... Paul Rudd, and that's never a bad things and he plays the plays the part great yet again, and some of the supporting cast are good also, Michael Douglas was bearable for a change, and I found Evangeline Lily to once again okay the Wasp well. Thee were some some action scenes in it and I found the CGI landscapes seemed to be visually stunning in places, and even though it maybe wasn't all great, to say this film was largely based on green screen, overall it was good.Unfortunately the film was let down by a few things, pacing being one of them as it is all over the place, which causes this to film to drag...a lot, especially in the middle section. There are also a few plot holes and issues that let the film down also. Many surrounding Janet:1. We were told she was alone in the quantum realm, yet she evidently spent years in there fighting a maniacal tyrant..... this never came up in conversation when she was home? Even when they decide to farm quantum particles at the end of the last ant man? Heads up might've been nice for Scott?2. If you're helping Cassie (who is apparently now also a technical genius???) build a machine to study the realm, maybe point out the dangers of it before she does something like this - don't tell her it's an empty realm then have a go at her for building it.3. When you're IN the realm and your family find out something is going on - tell them! None of this ""trust me"" ""there is no time"" crap!Also, I was under the impression, and could be wrong out this, that the suit protected the wearing when shrinking/enlarging, so I'm unsure why Scott and Cassie can take their helmets off, mid battle also, and it not affect them?Unfortunately for me, the main issues were the villains. M. O. D. O. K was never going to be an easy villain to show in live action - unfortunately some characters don't transfer well from page to screen, such as Galactus, so he was never going to look great, but it was the portrayal of him what was more annoying as, despite being feared as a hunter by the locals, he was purely played for laughs through the whole film. He was done better in the Avengers game! But for me the worst one was Kang! I guess the credits scenes show this character was somewhat of a red herring regarding being the ""next Thanos threat"", but this guy couldn't even lace his boots! At no point did we get any indication of his power or threat level, and gets beat rather easily by a regular human man who ""talks to ants"". I honestly expected some of the main cast to be killed in order to put across the threat level but no, everyone is fine - no trouble! Even after Scott and Hope seemingly get trapped in the quantum realm - oh hang on, let me just turn the machine back on... sorted!Also, the whole mulitiverse Kang situation doesn't entirely make much sense to me - so ""He who remains"" was worried of what would come if he got killed, which we all assume was this Kang we saw, who advises that he needs to get out of the realm and warned of what would happen if he didn't, but now he got killed, all the other variants, who banished him for trying to kill them all, decide now that Humans have killed him, they should kill the humans??? Huh?? What?? It really makes no sense?! To me, Kang would be better served just being the antagonist in the Loki series instead.So as always, it's sometimes easier to point out negatives than positives so it probably sounds like I hate this film, it's not perfect, but it's better than some of the more recent efforts."
negative,"If you've seen one MCU movie, you've seen this one as it does nothing more than check the same exact boxes every other MCU movie has checked for the last 10 years.Open with the hero being celebrated and trying to be normal? Check.Introduce a retconned back story for another character? Check.Try to inject humor that makes zero sense? Check.Try to have a badass moment that has zero build up? Check.Giant CGI battle where a bunch of characters that impacted the story in no way whatsoever are given 'dramatic' deaths? Check.Mcguffin that the heroes have to keep away from the bad guy? Check.Bad guy who has inconsistent powers? Check.New hero who spends the majority of the movie failing and learning how things work, but magically figures it all out in the big final battle? Check.Former villain returns, spends most of the movie still being a villain then randomly decides to be a good guy for no reason other than to needlessly sacrifice themselves and then get called an Avenger? Check.Deus ex machina that's set up early in the movie? Check.Paul Rudd, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Jonathan Majors all look and act bored. Kathryn Newton does her best Kristen Stewart impression. Bill Murray is there to collect a paycheck, and he looks and acts bored as well.Honestly, don't waste your money or time on this movie."
positive,"I thought this flick was pretty cool. Id maybe go see it again. I like that it didnt get into Star Trek territory. Maybe I just liked it because there hasnt been any good movies out lately. I loved seeing what the villain was all about. Id rather immerse myself in this CGI world than Avatar. It has some different characters, giving us something other than superheroes and tech. If youre looking for something to trip out on, something like Aquaman, its freaking awesome. The realm feels like when Dr Strange fought Dormammu, which was an wicked scene. When i compare it to the other stuff out there like on TV Carnival Row, Picard, Moon Girl...Quantumania blows them out of the microshpere."
positive,"Considering last movie of ant man, i knew how antman indirectly effect teh marvel universe and this movie also stand there. Story begins with lite comedy scenes and it does not take more time to jump to get seriousness. Once that phase begins story goes in fast mode. One important thing that this movie carry about they give proper job for supporting characters but missed three buddies of Scoot. You know whom I talking about. VFX and CGI was good but not up to the mark. It may have improved if they have given time. Introduction of Daddy Kang was biggest responsibility that this carried out and I am satisfied with that. But movie took my heart in last post credit and I was like i wanted more in that scene. Over all I love this movie as always like antman first and second part does."
negative,"This was really disastrous combination. The Antman films have come to be known for comedic moments so when they pivoted to such a serious story with such a supposedly threatening and monumental bad guy, you expect a tone change, but then along comes a certain character and brings down the whole thing with absolutely pathetic humour and the worst looking special effects I've seen in years. This is on the level of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, or Jar Jar Binks. It's really bad.Then there is the tropes that have become all too common for mcu movies at this point; large scale battle, cross cutting between individual characters, misplaced comedy... All detracts from at least one really powerful moment, that could have made the core of a fantastic movie, a moment when Scott regains his focus and works toward one goal rather than being drawn in all directions, that was very powerful.This is just the latest MCU product though and exhibits the same issues that I have been starting to notice in the past few years. At this point it's hard to ignore and it's stifling any creativity and good storytelling. This will probably be the last MCU movie I pay for."
positive,"The third Ant-Man is a spectacular visual spectacle, where filming in virtual studios brings an interesting world flirting with Star Wars and Dune, it is a brisk and entertaining spectacle, at the same time emotions and the great Jonathan Majors work in it. Kang the Conqueror is a pretty tough bastard who definitely has not said his last word and thats a good thing. The acting ensemble is quite old, but I have to mention Michelle Pfeiffer. She is a really beautiful woman and has her own charm. All in all, it is a fast-paced story, in a beautiful world full of wit, action and fun. I would be lying if I did not say that I was hoping for more emotion and harshness, but I will take this.Phase 5 begins!"
positive,"ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA (2023) **1/2 Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, Bill Murray, Katy O'Brian, William Jackson Harper, (Voice of: David Dastmalchian) Marvel's latest franchise endeavor reunites Rudd's Scott Lang with his family only to have them jettisoned back into the Quantum Realm where they encounter a subatomic universe with a deadly threat in the form of the diabolical Kang The Conqueror (Majors proving his mettle to be low-key lethal). While the gob-smacking CGI is chock-a-block with jaw-dropping visuals and state-of-the-art effects the hodgepodge of somewhat goofy set-pieces run more ridiculous (um no I did not need to see Corey Still ala Humpty Dumpy) than sublime (hello giantess Newton; thank you MCU!) (Dir: Peyton Reed)"
negative,"The movie, in my opinion, was quite interesting and fun up until the 3rd act. Perhaps it started to drag near the end of the 2nd. Antman & the Wasp Quantumania suffers from a problem that is recurring throughout the MCU films, and that is tying up the 3rd act in a satisfying end. This is usually in large part due to servicing the ongoing plot that is the MCU. However, there is a very noticeable decline in quality of narrative in the 3rd acts of most Phase 4 & 5 projects, despite the huge money thrown on screen. It all feels too manufactured, than created.The acting is all good, with Jonathan Majors absolutely crushing the role of Kang. The problems really rested with, in some part, the direction and, in large part, to the writing."
positive,"I have watched all of the phase 4, and it is much better than anything released in the previous phase. The acting of Jonathan Majors was fabulous. Every scene of Kang felt menacing. The movie established Kang as the big villain of MCU pretty well.However, the potential of Wasp and MODOK was wasted as they received very little run time. MODOK was just a comedy relief character. VFX were great. The MODOK with big head looked goofy but that's how it should look like. The MODOK did not look unrealistic unlike the floating head in Thor 4.There were some plot-holes, and logical mistakes but overall it was fun, as comic book movies should be. It had some good jokes, but they did not feel unnecessary like the jokes in Thor 4. In comparison with Thor 4, and Doctor Strange 2, it was a much better movie."
positive,"""It's never too late to stop being a di**.""Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an irresistible joy ride that manages to set up the new antagonist of the MCU in a creative, engaging, and fun way. Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is easily the standout and knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of the infamous comic book villain. Kang is portrayed as this ruthless and egomaniacal villain whose sole purpose is to erase universes and correct reality to his liking.I really believed for a moment that Scott Lang aka Ant-Man would either be stuck in the quantum realm or be viscously killed by Kang. Fortunately, Hope went back through the portal and saved him. The final showdown between Scott and Kang is a nail-biting and suspenseful experience. The visuals of the film looked spectacular but reached another level in that particular scene.Scott's hilarious voiceover is the perfect way to start and end this visually stunning and exhilarating blockbuster. I love how 99% of the film is set in the quantum realm. Seeing the characters travel through the vortex straight away immerses the viewer into this unknown reality.Of course, the elephant in the room needs to be addressed: M. O. D. O. K. M. O. D. O. K.'s appearance may seem odd and disconcerting at first, but throughout the movie I developed an extreme liking towards him, especially his hilarious redemption arc and the fight scene between him and Cassie.The first post-credit scene revealed that the council of Kangs are planning to prevent the Avengers from interfering in multiverse shenanigans. While the end credits scene included a brief teaser for the highly anticipated second season of Loki slated to be released sometime in summer 2023.To conclude, Quantumania capped off the Ant-Man trilogy in a fitting, satisfying, and mind-blowing way. To be perfectly candid, I expected to dislike this movie but ended up loving every minute of it. Once again, I disagree with the general consensus regarding Marvel films as of late. I'm one of the people who disdained Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, calling it the worst MCU movie since Thor: The Dark World. However, unlike critics and most of the general audience, I found the third instalment of the Ant-Man franchise to be an exhilarating, invigorating, action-packed, and immersive cinematic experience. Whenever I come out of a Marvel movie, I feel reinvigorated and an extreme rush of endorphins. To be succinct, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a non-stop thrill ride brimming with heart, humour, and creativity. I hope to see Scott, Hope, Cassie, Hank, and Janet in a potential fourth Ant-Man and the Wasp movie or another Marvel project. To quote Kang the Conqueror himself: ""It's never over.""Other tidbits:*Every Ant-Man movie relies on comedy, and Quantumania is no exception.*Scott Lang forming a human pyramid with variants of himself is one of the many highlights of the film.*I'd love to have the ability to understand foreign languages after drinking blood from a creature made of jelly devoid of any holes.*Kathryn Newton and Iman Vellani are one of the most kind-hearted, humble, and beautiful up and coming actresses in Hollywood today. Kathryn Newton was born to play the adored Cassie Lang. She fit right in, and her father-daughter chemistry with Paul Rudd felt natural. I am looking forward to seeing her interact with the young Avengers, especially Kate Bishop. I live by Cassie's inspirational words to M. O. D. O. K.: ""It's never too late to stop being a di**.""""There's always room to grow.""Final verdict: 9.5/10."
negative,"This movie can be worth watching if you follow these steps:
1) Get plenty of rest before you see it as act 1 is boring as $#!t
2) Remember that you are watching Ant-Man and not Star Wars. It's in Act 2 where things get interesting.3) The beginning is the time to use the restroom. There are some interesting things that happen in Act 3 later on but for the most part the Marvel formula is present.4) There are 2 after credit scenes. The first is the best (as I am a fan of the comics). The second, I don't know what the hype is about (as I am not a fan of Disney+)MODOK cgi sucked. You may have to go to a physician afterwards for 'blue screen fatigue'. Yes, they have to do it as the scenes cannot be replicated inexpensively in the real world, but there is a clear lack of emotion from the actors as they are not interacting with an environment when they are shooting a scene.The humor has been tamped down which was a pleasant surprise. Subliminal activist messaging was present but not pervasive.Overall, not as bad as I thought it would be but not as good as it could have been."
negative,"I don't mean to be disrespectful to anyone involved, I know that nobody sets out to make a bad movie. Yet again though, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is yet another PG13, CGI mud fest.So when we pick up, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is walking down the streets of San Francisco underneath the theme song from Welcome Back, Kotter....After a quick voiceover the characters are inexplicably flung into the throes of a Star Wars, CGI, acid trip. Even though some of the visuals are interesting, this movie has no discernible plot. It is literally just one, big CGI mud fest after another. If you told me that this movie was written by a third grade boy on a sugar, I wouldn't fall out of my chair in the shock.The true crime here is that for months on end, Marvel have touted Quantumania as ""An Avengers Level Event"", which was clearly a blatant lie. At the end of the film, nothing has taken place.It's a crying shame."
positive,"I try not to be a contrarian (at least intentionally) when it comes to films and I went in with pretty mild expectations because of the ratings on this so far. But Quantumania was not only an awesome experience but I think it's easily the best Ant-Man movie!Sure there's goofy dialogue, Cassie's script was doing her NO favors. But Jonathan Majors was great as a villain and the battles actually got pretty intense. I also see everyone talking about how bad the effects were, like did we watch the same movie? I loved all the wacky elements, it's closer to what I was hoping for in Multiverse of Madness, but I'm cool with a million tiny Paul Rudds too."
positive,"The Ant-Man series was appealing because it was a small scale Superhero movie which allowed Marvel focus on a fun, personable and acceptably comedic story.Quantumania steps away from this as it serves as the major introduction of Kang the Conqueror on the big screen. This has a positive and negative impact on the film.Kang is easily the best part of the film. He is played excellently by Jonathan Majors and for the most part, has a great on screen presence. He's by far the most menacing villain we've seen in the Ant-Man series and pretty much carries the film alongside Ant-Man.We also get to explore the Quantum realm which looks unique when compared to most other marvel properties. There was a lot about it that felt like Star Wars. For the most part the CGI in the Quantum realm looked really good but one of the sub villains is by far the worst CGI character Marvel has ever created. It was legitimately off putting.There was also a lot of exposition to try and fill us in on what happened off screen to tie the Ant-Fam and Kang worlds together. It felt like I was listening to an audio book and the explanations weren't always well thought out. Not to mention, we get another Marvel child genius pop out of nowhere.Quantumania was an average entry into the MCU. It's not as bad as some critics have suggested but not enough to get you really excited for Phase 5. Whilst the scale of the movie increased it did manage to keep some of the charm and wit that has made the series enjoyable although it wasn't as well placed in this movie."
negative,"Marvel stans will defend anyting, including this atrocious movie.Wooden dialogue, the main actor in his own movie acting like fool or being undercut in his own movie. Just like other big name characters like the Hulk, Hawk Eye, and Thor. Is there a flu that makes them all act the same?Terrible script writers who know nothing about Marvel Comics.Kang the Conquerer is suppose to be an over-arching villain, the most important Kang and he's like a chump in this movie. Another villain made pointless in a useless movie, just like Namor in Wakanda Forever.There's no importance or deadliness to the Villains anymore. Now Marvel is starting to trash their best villains. Why? This is basically writers who have no idea how to write from Comic to Film or know anything about the characters.Instead of establishing Modok as a good character, he's another throw away joke villain. The character belongs with A. I. M, X-men and Captain American; what's he doing in an Ant Man movie? Do Marvel Script writers even read Marvel Comics?These are hollywood writers who live in their own bubble and think the Wasp saving every part of the world, is what a character should be.Pathetic."
positive,"Thb the movie was outstanding. I like the teamwork of ants and the characters plays the good work. Every character doing a great job. Mostly I like the animations and vfx that included in the movie. Also the work of antman and his daughter. The storyline was sometimes confusing but the storyline connects some parts after interval. The laughter movement was also a hit point in the movie, the humour perform by that character was cool. The modock was becomes small in the movie and do a okok work.Overall l like the actions presents in the movie and the storyline and animation.Watch it. The villian power was outstanding."
negative,"""Oh, Daddy - It's all my fault!"". Well no ""Cassie"" (Kathryn Newton), not quite. You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from ""Star Wars"" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing ""M. O. D. O. K"" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) after it had had a good time with ""V. I. N. C. E. N. T"" from ""The Black Hole"" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer ""Janet"" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of ""Kang the Conqueror"" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (""Pym"") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now. This is really forgettable fayre."
positive,"Why wait for the next instalment of Star Wars episodes when Marvel totally riff on George Lucas imagination in the latest instalment of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", even down to the bar scene.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily respectively as Ant-Man and the Wasp are back for the first time since 2018 in a solo story.This time they are taking the whole family on a teddy bears picnic into the Quantum Realm to deal with the time travelling terror of Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors from ""Lovecraft Country"") and his old mate Darren the Dick (Corey Stoll).So let's turn off our regulators, keep our helmets on and get ready to hear the words Pim Particles and Multiverse thrown around...a lot!Kang of course doesn't walk the time line like the rest of us...he just doesn't do linear.However, he does understand ""variants"" better than Sam Raimi.If you remember ""Honey I Shrunk The Kids"" or any of those corny ""Journey"" movies in the 70's you'll be partly prepared for what you are about to witness.This movie is very trippy and Sci-Fi.It's as if the writer, Jeff Loveness, was testing out illegal substances for a Government funded drug experiment.Watch out for: A wonderful cameo from an Oscar nominated actor making his third comic book role.Plus Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer looking great in her 60's) will air some dirty laundry and dark secrets.In this movie Ant-Man doesn't have to win his battle with Kang.They both just have to lose.It's such a shame to see an Oscar winning actor like Michael Douglas spend most of his time with his hands submerged in a bowl of jelly.This Father-Daughter flick could have easily been a 4 star film for the 31st movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it needed a little less conversation and a little more action please (as Elvis once told me).Stay for the final credits to get a clue as to what's coming in Phase 5 for the Avengers and how it will have a profound impact on the MCU."
positive,"It was good. It's not trying too hard to be any more than it needs to be. It's an introductory film to Phase 5. Honestly, this movie got bombed with bad reviews of people who forget this movie is a Marvel movie. It's not gonna be a cinematic masterpiece. I was entertained, so I liked it. It wasn't special and there are certainly better Marvel movies. But it's a good introduction to what is coming up next. This movie did what it needed to do, get us excited for Phase 5. Remember, people who didn't like this film are still gonna come back and watch every upcoming Marvel film from Phase 5 and beyond. While it does have a predictable and tame story, 90% of movies are predictable anyway. We don't watch movies for the ending, we watch them for what leads up to it. It's an enjoyable superhero film that people will come back to appreciate if Phase 5 gets it right."
positive,"First up, the movie is decent.Of course, I went with low expectations after all those bad reviews. However, I think even unprimed the movie is actually better than the masses think this time.One critique I have read several times is that it would be an incoherent mess. I cannot comprehend this critique at all, as I find the movie to follow a clear red-line throughout.Moreover the CGI did not strike me as that bad either.It does feel at times more like a Star Wars movie than another MCU one because of all the creatures etc. But, hey, that is the Multiverse now.Of course there are some illogical points. Like why would Janet never have told any of that? Of course it is kind of out of the blue added and does not match up so nicely with the previous storylines but I think it is forgivable and not the first time stuff like this happens.I do think it is an Ant-Man movie and not an Ant-Man and the Wasp movie as the Wasp barely plays a significant role. That is okay either. It was good the 2nd was titled that way but I think Marvel should have the guts to go back to Ant-Man only if it makes more sense. After all comic book issues also frequently change their titles that way.The pacing surely is different than in previous Ant-Man movies but I liked how they took time sometimes for introducing Kang the Conquerer etc and there were some quiet scenes overall quite fitting.In any case, overall, I do not think it was that bad even by other MCU standards. Not Infinity War Material clearly but still a good Sunday afternoon feature."
negative,"Waited for long to watch ant man again, but how come I am so disappointed? Ant man was the most unnoticed hero in the avengers, and he is still one in this movie. The story is most about the hidden adventure of Michelle, and to evolve the next big boss (Kang), how come the plot become so unrealistic? I was so bored in the middle and wanna the movie to finish asap. The fighting scenes are not attractive and the big boss is so weak (even I know there are so many replicates of him at last). Cannot think too much good things Inside (except his pretty gal and the funny telepathy man). Really hope the plot can be better and the next universe can become better. Miss those original avengers movies..."
negative,"Another season, another entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the thirty-first entry into the franchise and, like at least the last twelve before it, does nothing to renew or revitalize the cinematic behemoth's trite formula. Peyton Reed is back in the director's chair, enthusiastically kowtowing to the demands of producers and ensuring there is no detectable sense of style or personal touch.Quantumania plays like a cross between tediously scripted Saturday morning cartoon and embarrassingly generic Star Wars rip-off, evoking no sense of fun or wonder despite creative makeup, costuming, and digital landscapes. It's utterly disposable and completely forgettable, but the theater was full at 3:00 pm on a Thursday, so silver lining, it will line some cultural overlords' pockets with cash.The film follows Scott Lang and company as they're sucked into the quantum realm, a land of mind-bending vistas and infinite possibilities. As Lang discovers the secrets of the realm and tries to protect his daughter Cassie, a new threat rises. Kang the Conqueror, one of Marvel's most powerful villains, takes advantage of the newly available Pym Particles, enacting a savage plan to nebulously do something or another. The film also introduces M. O. D. O. K, immediately butchering his characterization and badassery.The MCU runs the gamut from inspired to miserably inept. Quantumania proudly slots into the center of the spectrum, not nearly as imaginative or well-crafted as Iron Man or Infinity War, but not as boring or portentous as Thor: The Dark World or Eternals. It squeezes so snugly into its predestined mediocrity that it's difficult to scrape up thoughts which haven't been said of any other MCU film from the last two years.The tone is still scatterbrained due to incessant quipping, the filmic craft is still laughably corporatized, the CGI is still creative and complex though horrendously fake-looking, the villain is still stripped of all complexity or intrigue, and the heroes are still indestructible paragons of status quo ubiquity.Specifically, Quantumania's story unfolds sluggishly before kicking into hyper-speed. There's hardly time for character introductions, let alone character growth. A few minutes' stretch sets up a story of trust, subversion, and calculation, but is quickly bolled over for an overplayed, gratingly uninspired rebellion angle. By the time our characters are situated in this strange new world, the final act has started, and quickly becomes a typically rote slog.None of the performances elevate the film, though Paul Rudd is eminently likeable and Michael Douglas plays up to the stupidity of the material, charismatically smartassing his way through the adventure. Kathryn Newton is charming enough, Michelle Pfeiffer lends legitimacy to the inanity, and Evangeline Lilly...doesn't really have much to do, honestly.Jonathan Majors is the disappointment of the cast, always just teetering on the verge of sobbing no matter the scene or context. Kang is an all-powerful force of destruction, but Majors plays him like he never left the set for The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He's a great actor, but not an intimidator - he may have added thirty extra pounds of muscle to transform into a daunting presence in Creed III, but he didn't here; all he has here is a cool-looking cloak.What else is there to extrapolate after thirty previous entries? For perspective, the Bond franchise has been running for sixty years and just recently celebrated the twenty-fifth entry into its franchise, and where Bond has reasonably shifted its values, identity, and presence throughout several decades, the MCU continuously doubles down on its commitment to assembly line productions.The true shame is that, despite the staggering volume of the genre over the last twenty years, its context and potential for alteration (fundamental or superficial) has hardly been mined. Imagine a three-hour sweeping superhero epic, a dusty superhero western, or a psychological horror of superpowered insanity, all of varying budgets, tones, moods, styles, and complexity.Take the thought further - hire legendary filmmakers like David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darron Aronofsky, the Coen Brothers, David Fincher, or (your favorite filmmaker). Sure, not everyone would go for the idea, but those who do would surely produce something of staggering ingenuity and creativity; the inexhaustible subtext of a superpowered world could be explored for decades, and these production companies have limitless resources to explore it.All a pipedream. Rather than force their audiences to grow up, Marvel and DC eagerly cater to their infantilized, developmentally arrested fanbases, slapping together content like Chinese day laborers, desperate to keep the dopamine perpetually dripping. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be here soon, The Marvels soon after that.Writing this review was tedious enough; I cower to think of recording thoughts for MCU film number thirty-eight, number thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, onward and onward for eternity, until the Canadians invade, the dollar collapses, or The Living Tribunal is caught in a human trafficking scheme. Either way, blessed release."
positive,This movie had everything from a badass bad guy kang the destroyer I loved what they did constantly throughout the movie with Darren with a cool style for his set. I paid close attention to the acting and I must say it wasn't that great and like I've read before marvel could of spent a little longer developing this movie. Overall I thought it was brilliant with the humour and I'm a fan of kang hopefully we will see him some more. I don't like how Scott's daughter had a suite and was getting involved but that seems to be a repetitive thing that happens in movies now a days. Definitely a good watch and I recommend having an edible before hand lol.
negative,"There are parts of this movie that I genuinely liked, and other parts that are really really mediocre. I wouldn't say bad necessarily, but just really dull and disappointing.So first the good. I do think Kang has a lot of potential, but it hasn't quite been filled yet, and it was a good thing that Loki was the first view of this character concept instead of this one. Kang is building up to something big, and this step on the ladder is one that falls just a little short.So my main issues with Kang specifically are that a lot of aspects of his character are as of yet unexplained. His power set is vaguely powerful. He has telekinetic powers, and can shoot beams that can vaporize people, but he gets overpowered by giant ants? Ok, I guess.I just hope they show him to be a bigger threat than Thanos. Thanos in Infinity War was so incredibly powerful, and I am yet to be convinced that Kang is any more a threat.So for the other stuff. This movie is just a boring Star Wars ripoff. So you're telling me that this amazing Quantum Realm is just Space again? There is literally nothing distinguishing the Quantum realm from anything that has been in Guardians of the Galaxy. Not only that, but the Star Wars comparison goes all the way down to having rebels, people who play both sides, faceless goons, etc. The only difference is you have to shrink instead of fly into space to get there.They really had an opportunity to get goofy with it, and they just didn't for the most part. The most creative part is the alien that you drink his juice in order to understand the quantum realm's languages. That's it.With MODOK, I'm sort of mixed with him. I like the way they introduce him, and explain why he looks like that, but it feels like they can't decide whether to make him a comic relief character or a competent secondary villain. And him heel-face turning at the last minute because Ant-Man's daughter told him to not be a dick was just dumb. Way to kill off another interesting villain from your comics, Marvel. Please stop doing that.Speaking of Ant-Man's daughter. Ooof. I don't think it's the actor's fault, but damn she's annoying and badly written. They try and make her sort of this woke zoomer archetype who gets arrested for protesting a homeless removal effort, but it felt like a comittee of boomers were writing this character to appeal to zoomers instead of actually paying attention to what they're actually like. Cool she has a suit though.What else? Um...Hope had next to nothing to do. She was just there for the ride. At least Hank Pym did the ant thing with the smart ants, and Michelle Pfeiffer was the instigator of the plot, and should've been the protagonist to be honest.Yeah, that's it. Watch it for Kang. Rest of it is dumb."
negative,"Starting off with Cassey, she's probably one of the worst actresses that I have ever seen acting in the MCU, And oh boy have i seen bad actors here. This movie doesn't have a direction, it starts shooting towards all directions in hopes to some of each succeed. That, unfortunately, didn't happen. Of course, I am delighted to watch an Ant-Man movie once again, and have the chance to watch Loki and a glimpse of his return? That kind of scrambled my emotions. Because I really enjoyed the Loki TV show and the path it has gotten. Sincerely, when I witnessed KANG THE CONQUEROR, the man who saw all possible futures and endings were defeated by some very smart ants. I just wanted to leave. But I stayed in hopes to watch Loki, which happened, So, a fair trade."
positive,"Yes. I love the introduction of Kang, The Conqueror. Jonathan is definitely suitable for this role. Very convincing. Kathryn also need to improve more on acting, when doing emotional scene, she not good yet. Storyline is a bit flaws. It's like more on the Scott family, and less Kang story. Also, a lot of CGI using, it's like you watching James Avatar. Also side character, brings this movie a bit comedy, I like the slime (always talk about holes😂😂😂). By the way, it is worth watching. It is a must, if you waiting for the fourth avengers, then you must because it will continue from this movie (spoilers)."
negative,"Everything is going great in Scott Lang's world. He's a successful author, he has his relationship with Hope van Dyne, and his bond with his daughter couldn't be stonger. All that changes when the three of them, along with Janet Van Dyne and Hank Pym, are transported to the Quantum Realm, taking them on an adventure that has them facing off against their most dangerous opponet yet.With Quantumania, Peyton Reed is the second MCU director to take a character through a full trilogy. With Ant-Man, Reed and his team crafted a simple heist film, a construct that worked famously within the confined of the shared universe. Ant-Man and The Wasp expanded the scope of Scott's world, giving viewers a Ferris Bueller-style adventure comedy focused on rescuing Janet van Dyne from the Quantum Realm. With Quantumania, the smaller, more character focused storytelling has largely been traded in for a wide ranging, consequence-heavy epic that feels out of step with its previous outings. Gone are the good natured antics and warmth of the X-Con gang, who fail to appear in the movie, replaced instead by an underdeveloped band of freedom fighters. The tone of the Ant-Man franchise, the foolish absurdity that Paul Rudd has made his bread and butter over the decades, quickly dissipates in the film's opening act, replaced by jokes that land at an inconsistent rate and cameos that ultimately amount to nothing.Written by Rick and Morty writer Jeff Loveness, the overall issue with Quantumania lies in the story. If the purpose of the story is to introduce Kang the Conqueror as the next overarching villain of the MCU, the ball was certainly fumbled here. While Kang is undeniably a threat, he doesn't feel like an Avengers-level threat during or after the events of this film. While the post credit scenes do a little to push the narrative, the movie itself fails at establishing Kang as a worthy menace, never fully revealing his overall goal outside of escaping the Quantum Realm. The Multiverse Saga was teased and set up throughout Phase 4, doing double duty as something of a dénouement of the Infinity Saga, but after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Loki, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, audiences were poised to delve fully into the multiverse and Kang's tyrannical reign upon it. Unfortunately, no such thing happens in Quantumania, continuing to leave audiences in the dark about what's coming or anyone's role in it (except Sylvie, her role was very clearly defined). It's this lack of clear definition that may leave some lukewarm on the run up to 2025's Kang Dynasty, a movie that Loveness is also the writer of.Starring Paul Rudd, Quantumania takes the time to explore the relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter Cassie. The overall theme and strongest throughline of the trilogy has been Scott's love for his daughter and this movie continues it; Rudd and Kathryn Newton have excellent chemistry together. Typically the happy-go-lucky Avenger, Rudd is able to expand a bit thanks the more dramatic elements of the film. These scenes Rudd, an actor proven that he can be just as good dramatically as he can comedically, handles with ease.The story's decision to fixate on Scott and Cassie's relationship comes at the detriment of almost every other character on screen, save Kang. Hank Pym, once again played beautifully by the seemingly perennially cantankerous Michael Douglas, has woefully little to do in this film, relegated to the background throughout the majority of the runtime. The same can be said for Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp, hanging back and serving little purpose other than to ask the questions the audience is already thinking. While the relationship between Lang and Hope van Dyne was fractured between the first two Ant-Man movies, time has managed to heal all wounds between the two here. Rudd and Lilly are always great together, with Lilly's no-nonsense nature counterbalancing Rudd's goofiness perfectly. With Quantumania, however, audiences don't get much interaction between the characters. Lilly is fine in the role, but sadly, is given little to do outside of one major scene.Michelle Pfiffer, bascially teased in the last minutes of Ant-Man and The Wasp, comes to forefront here in Quantumania as the audience's guide through the strange world. Pfiffer carries weight in the movie as Janet van Dyne navigates the heroes through the terrain while providing the necessary back story on Kang. Her agency in the movie cannot be denied, and while she takes a step back later in the film as Kang and Lang square off, she dominates the first half.Jonathan Majors is Kang. A complete 180 turnaround from the character he played in the last episode of Loki, this iteration of the character is as ruthless as he is cunning. Physically, Majors takes up space on the screen, and while he's roughly the same height as Rudd, it's Majors' presence that makes him seem larger than he is. The first of two antagonistic roles this year, Quantumania shows that while he's up to the task, the script and story don't rise to his skillset. Majors is fascinating on the screen; Kang the Conqueror doesn't fully reach the expectations levied upon him by producer Kevin Feige.The most disappointing element of the film is M. O. D. O. K. While impressive visually, and voice acted well enough by Ant-Man returnee Corey Stoll, the arc that began for Darren Cross in the first movie sees a limp and unsatisfying conclusion here. Sprinkled throughout the film generously, a lot of the jokes designed for or surrounding him fall flat in way that can't help but be reminiscent of Thor: Love and Thunder.Peyton Reed's ambition has to be admired. With some of the best visual effects since the MCU has entered the Multiverse Saga, Quantumania is a sight to behold. From the moment the characters enter the Quantum Realm, the background of almost any scene seems to be something pulled from Reed's fever dreams. While that doesn't always work in the film's favor (the actors rarely interact with the background, at times leaving a clear visual impression of two people standing in front of a screen), the praised must be heaped on the visual effects team. The trip to the Quantum Realm, the Mos Eisley cantina-esque scene, and the bevy of creatures found inhabiting the land have many comparing the movie to Star Wars, and rightfully so. It can't go overlooked that Reed unabashedly loves the Fantastic Four and actively worked on a film treatment long ago; there's scenes and ideas throughout that nod to his love of wacky space adventures. While the film's pacing is problematic, especially in its shaky first act, once Kang is finally introduced, the storytelling settles into its pace. Once established, the second act shines as the film's highlight, giving the story the feel of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, painting parts of the Quantum Realm as a desolate wasteland completely unlike what was shown near the end of Ant-Man and The Wasp. The third act, the weakest of the trilogy, enters absurd territory as Scott fights to stop Kang from enacting his nefarious scheme.Overall, Quantumania, while still entertaining at times, lacks the magic of its predecessors. The original spirit of the characters, the charm of Paul Rudd, and the low stakes of the Ant-Man franchise are absent, leaving viewers with a bleaker tone and a lack of goofy charisma they've come to expect. While Peyton Reed is still taking ambitious swings, a number of ideas don't fully connect, leaving the audience with a story that doesn't fully lives up to its potential. Rudd continues to be delightful, Jonathan Majors is appropriately menacing, and Kathryn Newton is a great addition, making the outcome of this project all the more baffling. Worth seeing on the biggest possible screen thanks to some of the great visual effects, Quantumania may have some viewers continuing to question the overall quality of the post-Endgame world we live in."
positive,"I love Marvel movies, but there's something about this one that made me feel that I was watching Spy Kids film. Some bad CGI for Marvel. What's up with that?🚨Spoiler alert 🚨M. O. D. O. K's CGI is the saddest of them all. A big headed monstrosity that looks like Pac Man. Also, his back story, I don't know, I don't like when writers change a character's back story.Overall, the movie is fun to watch, and if you like the MCU you will enjoy it. Probably not the best MCU Movie, but there are worse. Paul Rudd makes all the Antman movies worth it. Same here. He's a funny guy.Now, the movie plot could've been better."
negative,"Ant-Man 1 and 2 were much better movies for many reasons compared to Ant-Man 3 Quantumania. The first film felt more like a non superhero film with low stakes but still a lot of character building, Scott Lang recently gets out of prison but is trying hard to win back his daughter. The first and second Ant-Man film as laugh out loud funny, and especially the second film which probably is the funniest Marvel superhero movie ever (yes, funnier than Deadpool 1 and 2 which I didn't think were all that funny). The 3rd Ant-Man film was not that funny, though there were a few funny moments but I didn't really laugh out loud, the humor felt more like cartoon humor for children while the previous films were funny for both adults and children alike. Speaking of it being for children, the Ant-Man 3 film felt like it was heavily ""Disneyfied"" with much less violence and the violence seem like it has been toned down, plus there was no kiss at the end when Ant-Man and the Wasp saved the day which made it feel like there's no chemistry between the two. Hope's father, Hank, was barely in the 3rd film, while he was integral in the first two films. The 2nd Ant-Man film had way more action sequence, and the buildup was much better (especially when Hank finally reunites with Janet after like 30 years, getting into the Quantum realm to save her finally, and plus they actually kissed unlike Hope and Scott in Ant-Man 3... so the the love between the characters felt more real in the previous films). The boring thing in Ant-Man 3 is they used the same old trope of inspiring the common folk to rise up and fight back against the oppressors, very similar to many movies like Star Wars, Dune, Lord of the Rings, etc. It just felt outdated for a big movie in 2023. It seems like Disney is going to far with the campiness, just like they did in Thor 4 Love and Thunder which that film and Ant-Man 3 felt like it was a movie mostly meant for kids to watch. I guess it's a money making strategy to make it very family friendly and light hearted but it starts to become stale and people get sick of it. A lot of people diss the DC films like Man of Steel (2013) or Zack Snyder's Justice League saying it's too serious and not funny/campy enough, but looking back, I think people are now realizing that these films have more depth and an artistic feel to it.But enough of the bad stuff, the movie did do some good things. Paul Rudd has great comedic timing as always, and he is always likable no matter what. There were some funny scenes such as when Hank gets jealous of Lord Krylar (played by Bill Murray). Jonathan Majors did a great job as Kang, the acting was good.Disney and Marvel kind of ruined this film. The thing that makes Marvel so big and popular is also the thing that is ruining their movies, they are a double edged sword. They wanted everything in the MCU to connect, so they used Ant-Man 3 to introduce the big bad guy, Kang... And they want to introduce a future young hero, Cassie (Ant-Girl), and have her in a future young Avengers movie. The first two films didn't really have anything to do with the main story of the MCU, except only in the end credits scenes. And then Marvel and Disney's obsession with making campy kid friendly films, and the heavily reduced violence disliking kissing in the movies for some reason (no kiss in Ant-man 3, no kissing in the first Disney Star Wars movie). Many have said people are ""burnt out"" seeing superhero films... But I don't think that's necessarily true, I think people are tired of the same old stuff and the movies becoming far too light hearted to the point where people don't even take it seriously anymore. Hence why I mentioned earlier about the early DC movies (ones written by Christopher Nolan, like the Dark Knight trilogy and Man of Steel), these films feel more than just superhero films as they have more seriousness and depth which makes it feel like a non superheroe film. But if you're going to make a funny movie, then make it funny like the first and second Ant-Man films, maybe they should have gotten Paul Rudd involved with the writing to help the jokes land better... And they need to make a movie that adults could enjoy, not just only for kids. I give it a 6 out of 10 because I still enjoyed it somewhat but it was disappointing."
negative,"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out."
positive,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me."
negative,"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park."
negative,"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C."
negative,"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it."
negative,"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023)"
negative,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10."
positive,"LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0."
positive,"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."
negative,"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men."
positive,"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments."
positive,"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential."
negative,".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us."
negative,"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off."
positive,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible."
negative,"The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe."
positive,"I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain."
positive,"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!"
negative,"I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short."
negative,"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not."
positive,"8.5/10
I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion."
negative,"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will."
positive,"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one."
positive,"I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter."
positive,"The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
positive,"The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie."
positive,"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is an enjoyable film, even with its very apparent flaws. The cast mostly performs well, highlighted by Rudd, who is especially entertaining, as well as Majors, Pfeiffer, and Douglas. Majors simply contributes an intriguing mystique to the role of Kang and is undoubtedly very good casting to the role. Notably, much of the CGI also does work, between intriguing visuals and fun character design. Unfortunately, the picture's screenplay is a mixed product and therefore its most impeding element. The film's beginning is simultaneously slow and forced, lacking any sort of genuineness. Despite the presence of intriguing characters and conflicts thereafter, the film still experiences various rather underwhelming moments. This is undoubtedly a result of lacking character development, which particularly hurts the introduction of many supporting roles, in addition to some poorly written dialogue. The most middling aspect of the picture, though, is its comedy. Rudd is often able to make the actually funny jokes work, but each piece of humor nonetheless clashes with the dramatic-leaning plot. This being said, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a worthwhile time for MCU fans who enjoyed the first two films of the trilogy."
negative,"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness."
positive,"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."
positive,"The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name."
negative,"As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues."
negative,"What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!"
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once."
negative,"Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with."
positive,"I saw this when it first came out but i wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on the state of the MCU. Antman is probably one of my favorite MCU movie full stop. Antman and the Wasp as very solid follow up with ties to the greater universe. This im still conflicted about!Theres nothing to say about Paul Rudd that hasnt already been said playing this character! He as always is awesome! Brings the fun in any of the moments of danger in a genuine way. But when you get the characters that are meant to bring this back to earth like Hank and Hope being the comic relief it just doesnt work. They try to make jokes but these kind of characters just shouldnt be!Majors on the other hand is an awesome addition to the MCU and can certainly take the franchise going forward. I would have loved to see at least one of the ant family die in this it would have really shown how far Kang is going to take things! With his recent arrest im really not sure how the MCU is going to hold up losing this character thats been being built for the last couple of years!The story was just to vast for the type of stories that we have come to expect from Antman. We love the heist movies of the last 2 but this tried to be that and also create a grander segway into the larger MCU. The whole MCU at the moment is rudderless, the best moments of the MCU is when they have time to let the dust settle and then get hyped for the next one. With 3 shows and 4 movies a year its like theres always something MCU going on. Seeing the events of Captain America Winter Solider and then something different as Guardians but then nothing for a year just makes you want things more! Its becoming way to stagnate in seeing things nearly every month!"

Johnathon Majors will be nominated for an Oscar in the next 5 years...he is a brilliant actor. To paraphrase Die Hard, Disney has the MCU playbook and they're running it step by step. Of course, I will throw my wallet at it when the steelbook comes out...the 3D wasn't very good, but 2D is worth a watch."
positive,"If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit."
negative,"The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content."
positive,"I don't see what peoples issues are with this movie. You get the idea of what you're going in for from the trailer, and if u liked the trailer then i can't see why the poor reviews. I enjoyed this just as much as the second ant man movie. I thought it was better than Thor 4 and Black Panther 2. I even went and watched this movie twice. And enjoyed it just as much the second time. It was funny, had a great villain, good action scenes and visual effects and this time round was more like a guardians of the galaxy movie than watching just a man shrinking around San Francisco. All the actors were on top form again and Johnathan Majors was awesome as Kang. I hope to see an ant man 4!"
positive,"""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!"
negative,"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of."
negative,So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.
positive,"I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
positive,"I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man."
positive,Its a pretty good marvel movie it lacks at some points and shines on others . The climax is pretty good . And it set up the base for other Marvel movies. Kang the conqueror is so intimidating.. Jonathan Majors performance has stolen the whole show .. vfc quality is Fluctuating its great at some point and average at some . But it dint get that noticable. Paul has plain of fantastic role of antman and the most post credit scene create the higher for the future of the Marvel cinematic universe it is quite great and give Shiva gives you a little hands about what the future and Marvel cinematic universe is gonna be . After this movie you will be excited for gang dynasty and Avengers secret wars.
positive,"We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that."
negative,"SDORE: 3.3/10I've never been so upset about having to write a movie review before. This one hurts. Marvel, what are we doing? This movie felt like one giant inside joke that I was not in on. I did somewhat enjoy the Star Wars type vibes, but it was a massive miss in all other areas. To me, it tried to take the humor from Love and Thunder and the epicness of Multiverse of Madness and shove them together, but I think by doing that they forgot who Ant-Man really is. Not including Luis and the gang is just a small example of how far they deviated from the story. I can tell that Kathryn Newton is a good Actor, but man were some of her scenes painful to watch. Everything up to Kang's introduction, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie, was extremely dumb and mind-numbing stuff. The storyline of Janet withholding information from everyone and reuniting with the creatures in the Quantum Realm felt like being around that one awkward Aunt who makes everything about herself. I'll talk about it a bit later, but the dialogue and delivery from some of the characters was awful, which truly made it a pain to get through. Watching a movie like this gives you a new appreciation from something like Multiverse of Madness. I hate to say it, but this is the worst MCU movie by a long shot.This movie has 2 semi-redeeming qualities and that's it. I say semi-redeeming because the good comes with the bad. It was kinda of funny, and by kind of funny I mean MODOK was hilarious. The group of creatures that Scott and Cassie come in contact with in the Quantum Realm were funny and entertaining. The rest of the humor was pretty bad, and a lot of that had to do with the dialogue and the delivery from the actors. So much of it just felt awkward and borderline cringey. The other good thing, to no one's surprise, was Kang and Jonathan Majors. Kang is going to play a huge role moving forward, and they couldn't have picked a more talented Actor to handle that challenge. His dialogue was extremely powerful and the delivery was on point per usual. When Kang was at full power it was crazy to watch and the end credit scenes gave me things to look forward to but, again, there was a lot of bad with the good. The story was so messy and chaotic that I was too stunned to fully enjoy his parts because of how awful the rest of it was. Hopefully this is not a sign of what is to come for the rest of Phase 5."
positive,"I loved this movie, I think it's much better than Ant-Man 2. I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews, and I really don't understand the backlash. It was a fun, fast paced adventure with what I will call an ""ensemble"" cast that had the usual fun dialog along the way. Yes, there was a lot of CGI. Yes, there was a transitional cast aspect. No, it wasn't like the movies that came before. This doesn't make the movie bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it! People that are complaining about a bad script, (I disagree), might think about the fact that this go around Paul Rudd wasn't part of the writing team. Maybe that was part of the imagined ""problem"".I highly recommend seeing this movie for Ant-Man fans. As far as critics' reviews are concerned, I usually find the movies they applaud aren't that good, and movies they dislike are some of my favorites. In short, go see it and make up your own mind. You just might have a great viewing experience."
negative,"Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU."
negative,"I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring..."
negative,"Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come."
positive,"Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film."
positive,"Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D."
positive,"Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word."
positive,"Big production, with good actors, magnificent CGI, and nice new elements, for a telling that is another deja vu. This script could have been written by chatgpt. Although Kevin Feige likes self conclusive film and TV series episodes, the time is too low to show a deep telling, and this is theresult: deja vu. Marvel is showing infinite variants of the same story. TV series has been saved from this cliché till now, doneting us original telling and great shows, but Kevin Feige said all this has to end: less series with more autoconclusive episodes. Probably this one will be the last Marvel movie I will see at Cinema. And if the depth of series will go down, I will stop to see series on Disney Channel. Sorry, but this is the business that is deleting the fantasy of Marvel and Disney old school: Marvel was a niche producer who gave us quality productions, now it has become a mainstream producer of mass-produced products. The future of entertainment appears more dark."
negative,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney."

positive,"At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU."
negative,"Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3."
positive,"Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.
7/10."
positive,"This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy."
positive,"So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB."
positive,"Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee."
positive,"To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most."
positive,"Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments."
negative,"What on earth has gone wrong with Marvel? Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film."
positive,"A good stand-alone movie that was only enhanced with the prior viewings and knowledge of Ant-Man, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and Avengers: End Game.Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeifer as Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne were respectable, stoic and even funny at times. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang stole the show as usual and will have you rolling. Evangeline Lilly as Hope was great support and will have you cheering her on. And the casting of Cassie Lang was spot on as she looks just like a grown up Cassie from the initial Ant-Man movie.The MODOK character will take some time to grow on you, but will leave you wanting more by the end. And although Kang's character will seem underwhelming with so much potential, all can be forgiven if understood that this is just a Kang VARIANT and most likely not KANG the CONQUERER as portrayed in the comics. Once the viewer realizes that this KANG was perhaps the Multiverse's best hope at challenging the Kang threat to come, then the plot begins to solidify into a firm foundation of what's to come in future MCU movies.Overall, this was a far better movie than the critics give it credit for. It had it's serious tones when it needed and it had it's mystery that even had die hard MCU enthusiasts questioning themselves. But most importantly, it had it's awesome action and fight scenes. It had it's edge-of-your seat reveals using high end special effects and it had it's timely and spot on humor. This Ant-Man movie is a must-see and probably places as 2nd best of the 3 behind the initial one in terms of quality and overall production."
negative,"If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases."
negative,"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
negative,"""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself."
positive,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
positive,"We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10."
positive,"I feel as if Kevin Feige likes to play connect four with characters in this universe. ""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no."
positive,"Marvel hunkers down with its Multiverse theme and begins its Phase Five chapter of the MCU with a complex story of time. As the title suggests, the majority of the film involves the quantum realm where time and space are diluted and distorted the further ""down""you go. It's 1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with much more magnification, so a dust particle in that version is a floating Everest in the, umm, quantumverse. How human-like entities live and have built a bustling city there is a whole other movie! How Kang and Janet knew each other for most of her time there, and how Kang ended up there is what this film elaborates, in bright, flashy colour!But, if you take away all the gorgeous green screen, ignore the setting and background, the marvelous suprise actors that appear, and the mesmorizing portrayal of Kang, you are left with a story about a daughter and her father. Cassie Lang is all grown up now, trying to make up for all those (5) years her dad and the Pym's went missing, either from the blip or lost in the quantum realm or in jail. Her father, Antman, is her hero above all other Avengers. And a lesson he taught her in the very first Ant-Man appears in action in this film. But the fame has gone to her dad's head, and he fails to see her achievements.All the while, Janet and Kang's backstory is revealed in flashes while our heroes, separated in the universe inside our world, face one danger after another. As Janet races to save her granddaughter, who is on the run with Scott, Dr. Hank begins to see his wife in a new light as her past catches up with them.A great entry into the majestic storytelling arc of comic books to film transition. I never forget the first Comic Books that caught my attention as a child were the ones based on mythologies - which we were learning at the time in school. So the Viking myths of Thor, the monsters and trails of the Odyssey, Hercules' strength and valor, and the power of morals all told in coloured boxes and speech bubbles are now portrayed by great actors and production crews, and yet the ideas, emotions and beliefs are still there under the bright lights and big bangs! That's what elevates Marvel movies, in my opinion.The filmmakers behind these 31 superhero films have solved the puzzle of keeping seats in butts, or vice versa, as the longer these films become, the longer we can sit through them without a break- toilet or distractions of any kind (smart phones)! I found the balance between dialogue/exposition, action sequences, and comedic breaks perfectly balanced to draw my attention back to the story just as I was phasing out. Maybe I was having a good attention day, too! For a minute or two I was trying to figure out where Cassie's Kathryn Newton was recognisable from, and it was two series I'd seen: Big Little Lies and, the lacklastre Netflix 'Lord of the Flies'-type show: The Society.The soundtrack was another surprising quality that at first I thought a let down, but rejoiced at the decision to keep it less Guardians and more original soundscapes by the end of the film. It balanced the here and there elements by using the trailer's Elton John anthem during the normal ""here"", and funky or jazzy sounds in the quantum ""there"". And even in the quantum realm, it seems, bands are formed and positions taken, like a Mad Max film, and not just the costumes!A nod to AntZ and Avatar, I'm sure, were made throughout the telling of this tall tale by the Yes Man & New Girl director Peyton Reed, his now-known style seeping through the screen. As the second trailer showed, when a good dad is worth fighting for, the good daughter steps up. The man being swallowed by the ant vortex mountain and saved by his loving daughter's outreached hand says more than a million novels could express, in whichever universe you can imagine!And this brings me to what I like to call: Multiverse for Dummies. Scientifically speaking, we are vibrating, humming, and energy-filled atoms that create a type of force field around each molecule, so in essence, around our whole being. By creating energy, we are simultaneously creating our own unique snail trail and projecting our ""future"" path. As time is irrelevant, because we only count the girations of the Earth around the Sun: this sun, our sun, not another; then by scientific standards, it could very well be possible to create two diverse paths when, for example, one is faced by a dilemma. One path is created to represent option one, and another to represent option two. This theory exponentionally creates infinite probabilities and/or paths. Is the thought or the intention the creators of this energy trail? So, a multiverse for one person could be every decision and branch thereof they've ever had, from what cereal to eat to whether they should marry or not. Each branch then has branches of its own, and each one to the tiniest twig has a different version of you. And by this theory of mind creating matter, there may even be a spaghetti fingers universe or a jelly pudding one, like other films have suggested. Kang has many versions of himself spread out through infinite branches, and some of them jailed this film's version in the tiny, microscopic quantum realm. The Disney series, Loki, may shed more light on this matter.As a stepping stone towards a great many more multiverse-opening films, this feels safe. A comfortable place to begin considering the possibilities that by deleting and pasting timelines into the already complex Cinematic and Disney Series Universe, we may see a new X-men, Deadpool, Thunderbolts, Blade and, even, the Fantastic Four back for more great stories. And as we know, as one story ends, another is about to begin."
positive,"Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!"
negative,"The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors."
positive,"I see that some reviewer on the web referred to this as Marvel's version of Star Wars. In fact I think there's a lot to that. Loads of weird creatures, a big cast, an evil empire and a rebel alliance, armies of identical storm troopers, and a huge CGI blast that is probably Marvel's biggest yet. This is like Star Wars in the same way that Shang-Chi: The Legend of the Ten Rings was like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.So this is the way they decided to introduce Kang full-on (after a short lead-in on the Loki streaming series) and generally I'm OK with it. Half an hour in to the show I really started to enjoy the ride. (More so, in fact, than I like any of the Star Wars series, which are undeniably splashy but have semi-random plots and dialog aimed at 8 year olds.)I want to give credit to the cast, more than I usually do. The ensemble nature of it works most of the time really well. The 'nuclear family' with Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, daughter Hope, and Scott and Cassie Lang were all played just fine by Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Newton. Though Scott is the headliner, I was pleasantly surprised by how much work they gave to Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton -- they rock. If anyone was sidelined a bit it was Lilly (really guys? She's in the title after all). Jonathan Majors is duly impressive as Kang, playing a wildly different version of him than He Who Remains who we saw in Loki. Katy O'Brian and William Jackson Harper are great as rebel leaders with distinctive abilities and make the most of their screen time. And Bill Murray ...Despite the long parade of action scenes and dialog that is just enough to understand what's going on, it flows well from end to end. With short 'bookend' sections in our everyday world, everything takes place in the Quantum Realm. It's all very colorful and imaginative at a level we didn't even see in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness.But just a final caveat: if this was *really* a quantum realm in the true physics sense, I probably don't need to say that it wouldn't look anything like this. The real thing? Absolutely anything we take for granted in the everyday world, like, I don't know, gravity? Structures? Sound and air? Light? Dialog? Nonexistent. Objects aren't even defined, they are just probability clouds. So this is all crazy in the same sense as our sci-fi settings like Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars too, violate basic principles by using FTL space travel and simultaneity.But I guess that's not the point. This is storytelling and I enjoyed watching this story."
negative,"It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+."
negative,"Another serving of bland, bombastic superhero sludge from the mcu mcmovie factory. More annoying middle-aged hollywood vacuum tubes flying around on wires in gimpy clown suits. More obnoxious tweeny super geniuses snarking, pouting and virtue signaling their way through 2 hours of nonsense while all the ""adults"" stand around lavishing them with worship and praise. More bright n' shiny cgi strobing to distract the drooling screengazers from the total absence of a coherent plot or a single believable, compelling character. It's all just a big amorphous slurry of multiverses, timeloops and contrivances at this point. After 2 hours of the blathering dingbat Paul Rudd, his spoiled, mindwashed brat, and all the aneurism inducing cgi baffoonery - I'm done."
positive,"This is a great introduction to what Kang could really do for the future of the MCU. The movie starts off a bit slow with some jokes that feel forced. However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past. There were scenes that would leave you ""wow"" but also ones that are uneccesary.Overall the plot of the movie was just alright. This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU."
positive,"Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure."
positive,"The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants."
negative,"This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme."
positive,"***Ant Man & the Wasp : Quantumania Movie Review ****Visually Splendid Experience... 🔥🔥🔥Scott Lang is back... This time he is on a mission to save his family from Kang: The Conqueror.Quantumania, Timeline, Kang Variants , Probability Storm & many more terminologies insights got from this movie...VFX i would personally view as Top Notch 🔥🔥Kang alias Jonathon Majors was outstanding. His small version was observed in Loki Season 1 but here he nailed the performance which i feel personally overshadowed the performance of Scott Lang & his team.2 Post credit scenes as always gives hopes to watch it's future Marvel Movies.Overall a visual treat experience movie which no doubt cannot afford to watch on a streaming platform."
positive,"This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating."
negative,Remember everything you loved about Ant man 1?Remember the heart pumping heist theme and the fun score that left you feeling pumped up and excited?Remember the trio of hillarious friends that Scott lang had and their antics?Remember the adorable chemistry between Scott and his daughter?Remember the menacing villain who made you feel uncomfortable and tense not knowing what was going to happen next?Remember when Marvel was a good franchise?Nah. Me neither.This movie has none of the stuff that made me like the first one (and even the second one to some extent)But what it does have is CGI.LOADS of it.What it does have is lots of yelling and screaming and shrinking and growing and bla bla bla boring empty spectacle.There's no heart here. No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis. Ittl take about 30 seconds and you'll have most of the details covered.
positive,"This MCU film is totally overhated without a reason... Firstly,the CGI were from another planet,the visuals were amazing...Also all the cast was great especially Jonathan Majors in the role of Kang the conqueror...He was terrifying.... He played Kang very well and in my opinion is better than Thanos...I am looking forward to see him in Loki season 2.... Furthermore the soundtrack was great and it fits perfectly to the epic final battle... Finally the two post credit scenes were awesome especially the first one with the council of Kangs.... Phase 5 MCU has began with the best way and is going to be peak...Be prepared for Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3."
positive,"A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!"
negative,"Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+."
positive,"'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending."
positive,"Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it."
positive,"The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather? Is Avatar the only franchise allowed to barf cgi at us with a mediocre script? Come on...Majors was great, the script was passable, and I laughed a ton. It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2. Curious to see how the timeline develops!"
positive,"""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project."
positive,"This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army."
negative,"Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat."
negative,"Positives: Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Paul Rudd are good and familiar. They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them."
positive,"At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2.."
positive,"I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies."
negative,"I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that."
positive,"I really enjoyed the first two movies, plot for the 3rd I really liked having visited the quantum realm besides Hope & Scott's Daughter Casey makes sense for it be be played out there.I loved the idea that the quantum realm has its eco system and it's own people and strange beings but it felt very Guardians of the galaxy but saying that set pieces were good and everyone putting in a good performance but Kang The Conqueror is meant to be the new big bad?Sadly not convinced, more of a pussy cat and very hard having seen how destructible Thanos was, was hoping for more!Other than that, enjoyed at most just not brilliant!"
positive,"This has been a usual marvel movie with all the commercial elements, a simple story with all techs and depth in that. The whole ant family has performed very well. It has fights talks etc. The usual ant man movie things with some humour to be kudos. It could have been different a bit but the movie has been reall usual nothing new. The one thing was kang , oh boy he is just master of conquerer. But such a strong villain been killed in a snap. But i hope something more to come in the future. Kang will return with bang. I am supporting a antogonist for the first time. Paul actually he is been a side stay, kang and janet being the main role played . But he just did justice to the role. It was entirely dominated by kang. As always a happy end to the movie. The main attraction in the post credit never miss it to watch it. Its really mindblowing, i dont want to spoil it. Please do watch it in theaters. A good start to phase 5."
positive,"First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential."
positive,"This was an enjoyable ride. There were glimpses, glimpses of that old Marvel magic at times, the humour, and a decent bad guy actually well used. But honestly Paul Rudd carries this film. He's the only actor who really shines, and eats up every scene he's in. The daughter and Kang are decent too.But it's good to watch a Marvel film without really any SJW nonsense. The focus on story and some jokes might be pushing Marvel back in the right direction (can only hope).The setting was unique and diffferent, but after a while it grated with the overuse of SciFi CGI. It's given me enough to want to see more Kang and maybe theres still life in the old Marvel yet."
positive,"People are acting like this movie is the latest Thor, it's not. It does have some silly moments. But there are plenty of intense moments as well. I went to go see this movie this afternoon and I finally felt like the MCU has hit its stride again. I feel like it's been awhile. I have not been a fan of the new marvel shows, I've honestly felt like they've been pretty lost. This is the first movie that has felt like the MCU is heading towards something, although it may not be the extract thing people guess. All I will say is that people need to give this movie a chance. I'm not a fanboy or a boy, I feel like a lot of the votes are from bots. It's a good movie and deserves a chance."
positive,Well all I can say is well And I thought that this film was very extraordinary And visually awesome however I am not the biggest Is aut_man fan But I am a massive Marvel fand I can tell you that this is my favorite Ant-Man In the trilogy even though The movie starts out a little bit slow but It gets better once all the characters go the Quantum realm and especially towards the end When You don't know if The villain of the film is dead or not I certainly think that if you Are a fan of This superhero Or Marvel Or big action Adventure films then this one is a good 1 to see I absolutely hope they make a 4 Is film And And can't wait to see what happens next I also Can't wait to watch the new Season of Loki.
negative,"This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!"
positive,"Best MCU movie since ""Spider-Mn: No Way Home!"" SO good and not to be missed. I cannot wait to see this movie again. Totally stands on its own, but is going to be the next chapter. SOOOOO good! The world-building is some of the best I've seen, very believable. So often, when movie create a totally new world, it is silly and doesn't make sense. Not in this case. And the inhabitants are far more than just actors in corny makeup. This is SO much better than Thor: Love and Thunder. Wonderful fleshing out of characters! Kang was amazing, acted wonderfully! I look forward to where the MCU goes next!!"
negative,"Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either."
negative,"I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor."
positive,"Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus."
positive,"It hasn't been a great last few outing for MARVEL and combined with the streaming shows, the Phase 4 didn't really hit the mark. With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best."
positive,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumanis is a good film and a good start to the MCU's Phase 5. Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10."
positive,"As another reviewer here has pointed out, this movie failed to introduce kang in its runtime and loki did it better in its finale. Kang the conqueror , is supposed to be an iconic villain and given the fact that he is played by majors , his story must be over the top. Kang has this power to freeze time and he uses that laser energy sorta thing . This guy freaki'n shattered timelines . There is no way scott will win. I want to see conqueror in action. This guy is the next villian of phase five and I cannot wait to look forward to it. Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies . But this movie proved I was wrong. Iam a marvel fanboy but even I am tired of this. It is obvious that marvel is hyping its audience for a future that will not come. GOTG 3 and loki season 2 are my only hope."
positive,"I was worried after hearing about initial mixed reviews and Quantumania being the second lowest scoring MCU film, but the critics were wrong - dead wrong. Quantumania is MCU's ode to Star Wars fun and it really works. The Ant-Man style of comedy is still there even though the stakes are much higher with the arrival of Kang the Conqueror who Jonathan Majors masterfully made the quintessence of intimidation and menace. Marvel made the best choice casting him as the next saga's big bad because his range, expression, and delivery are nonpareil. This guy is raw acting talent.A lot could have gone wrong with Quantumania. Like most of Phase 4, it could have gone too far and still have felt all for nothing. But it was the right amount of lunacy and imagination. The only stretch is MODOK. Yeah, everyone will no doubt agree the movie could've done without him and that he's undeniably the worst thing about the movie. Every scene he's in is so distracting and cringey. Only his last few ""brother"" and ""Avenger"" lines were tolerable - really funny actually. And while the script definitely suffered from spots of juvenile jests that I don't think even kids would find funny, all in all it still did a good job concisely giving backstories and delivering heart-felt moments between Scott and Cassie - the core characters of the story.Paul Rudd still rocks as Ant-Man. His comedic chops and timing always make him so entertaining to watch. Marvel can stop with his solo movies and throw him into every other film for buddy-com action and improve every movie. It would never get old.And I'll just say for the woke-watchers...there's no agenda of any sort in this movie. The swearing is even dialed back a lot especially compared to the last few MCU films. It's definitely more family entertainment."
positive,It wasn't as bad as people said. It was a decent film. Still Thor Love and Thunder is still goatedThis review was made on March 6 23About: The Ant family gets shrunk into the quantum realm. Jane has secrets. The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development. Everyone else was either just there or annoying/looked weird man . *cough* Cassie.When she said the D word to Modok it was so cringe funny.Overall the production and story went well. Way better than reviews stated.Highlight: I liked the possibility scene. Very creative.Quaz was good too. His queen reminded me of Rita. I liked her too. Kang too was iCONIC. Skrull Kang.Goofs: Cassie looked weird. I'm not sure why it was called Antman and Wasp. Wasp was very minor. She had no story.What can be learned? Secrets and Time are a dynamic duo.Should you watch this?: I say yes. Ignore the reviews and box office. Avatar 2 and 1 made a billion but those moves were not good. Antman 3 sets up a couple new events.
negative,"This is the worse written most nonsensical marvel movie, what a waste of 300 million, Paul Rudd seems like an extra in his own movie, Kang is easily defeated, dumb comedic tone, the quantum universe is poorly designed, the daughter is more powerful than modor, first time she uses the suit and she's a master, almost single handedly defeats Kang gimme a friking break, the way they handle the whole movie is a clear sign that the whole marvel universe is tired and should retire, they handle the whole quantum verse however is convenient to their badly written plot, just doesn't make sense at all, it's not even entertaining, cgi looks 20 years old, no emotion no climax no nothing, marvel you're done go home."
positive,"Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me."
positive,"Quantamania is a typical marvel movie with grand visuals and a story that has pretty much nothing to offer.Katheryn Newtown seems like a good choice for Cassie lang. Let's hope she has more to offer in the future.As for the story,it gives us the first look at much anticipated Kang the Conqueror and Jonathan Majors has done a phenomenal job in potraying the big bad. But after all those build-ups and hype surrounding Kang as the big bad for this saga, i kinda felt they downplayed him in the movie. For someone as powerful as Kang to go down like that seemed like an injustice to the character.Overall, quantamania is a fun watch but is forgettable once you walk out the theatres. Jonathan Majors is the stand out of the film and am excited for what he holds in the future."
negative,"Trash beyond anything I could ever imagine. They should give refunds to everyone who went to see this garbage.The most unlikable characters the MCU has ever produced. The movie only has two types of characters: annoying girl-boss and annoying pathetic loser. These characters aren't relatable because these are the type of people you run away from on the street.Let's dump 300million into the CGI vomit machine and hope no one realizes how terrible the movie is. This is the grand strategy behind the geniuses at Marvel. It's sad and pathetic.I'm giving this a 1/10 because it has no value, and I left the theater in a worse state than I went in."
negative,"There's not much to say about the movie, to be honest. Every year, we've been watching a lot of average Marvel movies, series, and mini-series.The worst thing about this film was that it had a lot of problems showing Kang's power, especially in the scene where Ant-Man and Wasp fought him in the last scene, the cheesiness annoyed me.The acting, script, directorial skill, even the progress and handling of the revolutionary theme in the final scene, everything was very normal and ordinary. We've seen too many similar things in many works.The part I liked was the good visualization of the quantum dimension, which was very Star Wars themed. Especially the first scene with quantum was great in the cinema. Also, the adaptation of MODOK character to the cinematic universe was good, but his dialogues and death made me extremely sad because they were bad.In short, there was nothing extra in the movie, it was watchable but the forced joke attempts and poorly executed villain characters ruined the movie. Marvel needs to be more careful now, and realize that spending a lot of money doesn't make a good movie. I think the writers, especially in Phase 4, need to accept the fact that they are doing a bad job and choose a different path. Finally, I should add that the mid-credit scene was really bad, the voice changing was cringe-worthy. It's an average movie that can be watched."
positive,"Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichés, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution."
negative,"Take Marvels recent lacklustre offerings, add some Avatar visuals and the dialogue and acting of the last few Star Wars films, and you have this. It's cheesy, in the extreme. It's chock full of the usual tropes and character motivators that plague Marvel films. It feels like we are being force fed the same story, over and over, in all their films. Most of the characters are unlikeable, shallow and forgettable. I stopped caring about any of them about 20, yawn inducing, minutes in. This is not good film making. Loud colours, over the top character dynamics and a weak plot, do not give you a good film. I felt like I was watching garishly dressed, looking for laughs and attention, annoyances. Clowns, in other words. I felt like I was watching clowns. And that makes me so sad."
positive,"Quantimania is a strange a little movie. It tries to be an adventure movie, an Ant-Man movie and almost an avenger movie of sorts. There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang."
positive,"7 is well-deserved but wanted to give 8 just because I think 6.6 is not enough.Very good movie. No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful."
negative,"Scott Skywalker, Princess Hope, Obi-Wan Hank and Cassie-Rey face off against the villainous Darth Kang who has created a Multi-Verse Killer.Kang is being protected by Quantum Realm Troopers who guard his sky city against a group of resistance fighters looking to take back their planet.Overall a pretty good film. Not great, but not bad. It was Marvel without being overtly Marvel. Very thin, somewhat predictable plot without any surprises or twist. But some great visuals, some decent action sequences and a few good laughs.I saw the 3D version which was decent. No distracting gimmicks. Just some good added depth."
negative,"The MCU used to be something I would get excited about. While obviously not artistic masterpieces, the MCU used to be fun popcorn entertainment that would be a good way to take your family to the theater and be entertained by charming characters and fun action sequences. Now, it's a pale shadow of what it used to be and seems to only get butts in seats based on brand recognition alone.Pretty much everything I hated about phase 4 is on full display here. The writing is juvenile, the visual effects are atrocious, the humor is obnoxious, the ""emotional"" scenes don't work and all of the characters are hollow and uninteresting. Although I did enjoy the post credits scene and a couple of moments scattered throughout the film, I was begging for this one to just end as it is 2 hours long yet it felt like 4 hours.I'm so sick and tired of this franchise that I really want it to die. After Guardians 3, I might be tapping out completely."
positive,"This movie was not as bad as everyone is claiming. Is it of the same caliber as Lord of the Rings.... No. However, based on them having to make a movie about Antman and the Wasp, while at the same time having to set up the next phase of Marvel, I thought they did a great job. It was a fun movie and the visuals I thought were great.I thought the acting was great and the story moved along well. It was the first movie I've seen with Jonathan Majors and I thought he did an amazing job and I'm excited to check out some of his other acting credits.I went in to this with lower expectations because I haven't been wild about the new content from the MCU but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.I know some people were upset with how MODOK was portrayed but I thought they did a great job making him a fun addition. There is no way to make MODOK in a live action movie serious. So making him the butt of a joke was a great way to add him.I recommend giving this movie a shot."
positive,"The movie sets up the future of MCU but as an individual story it's not that great. The storyline is too obvious and no elements of suprise & twist. From acting point of view the movie looses its string on emotional pov, especially the father - daughter chemistry of Scott & Cassy. Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.Overall an one time watch. The movie has 2 post credit scenes and both are important for future."
negative,"MCU is dead. It is official. They can't produce any good movie anymore. It would be a safe bet to not watch their upcoming movies as they will involve this lethargic concept of multi-verse. How much of the same thing with the only difference of theme can people keep watching?About this movie, the story is meh, full of cliches, and the plot is quite predictable. It is nothing like the first ant-man movie.Animations are overdone, very flashy sometimes and not good for weak eyes. They aren't beautiful either.Only save here is the acting by senior actors.Verdict: save your money and time. Don't watch."
positive,"So this is rated about the same as Thor love and thunder? Really? Love and thunder was a bad film, this really isn't in the same league! I really enjoyed it, took it for what it was, some entertainment in a make believe world. Wasn't disappointed.Yes Marvel are churning out films like kids for child support.. doesn't mean they are all bad.. this seems to be the popular notion and go to criticism. Looking forward to seeing where the new story arc goes, hope they don't pull a love and thunder with the next Guardians film!In short, watch it, don't take it seriously and just enjoy it.. you won't be disappointed."
positive,"The movie is what it is; just for fun. Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun."
positive,"As a kid, I read and re-read Marvel Premiere #47, which showed how Scott Lang became Ant-Man. Written by David Michelinie and drawn by X-Men team of teams John Byrne and Terry Austin, it was a story I read and re-read and if you have ever seen the way I draw comic books, so much of it comes from this issue.So when it comes to that whole ""Are comics cinema?"" back and forth argument, I think you can figure out what side I'm on. Are there too many comic book movies? Were there too many giallo from 1970-1975? Did Italy make too many Westerns? Were there too many slashers in 1981? Can there be too much of something that you love?Alright, now that I have gotten past the legally required nod to serious criticism, let me tell you why I enjoyed this movie about humanoid broccoli.After the Avengers save everything from Thanos, former criminal and current Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled down from being Ant-Man, instead enjoying life as a writer, husband of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and father of Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), who is upset that her father isn't fighting for people any longer, instead enjoying the fruits of his hard work and resting on his laurels. There's a moment that's interesting here, as she discusses all the people who were displaced in the time where Thanos killed half of reality and now are homeless. Yes, it'd be great to explore this but this is a popcorn movie that soon moves past that; I'm not suggesting a popcorn movie delve into that, but hey, if there ends up being a Disney+ D-Man series that does, I'd watch that. Also, the fact that I just casually namedropped D-Man should explain why I never went to the prom.Anyways, Cassie has been working with her stepmother Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to communicate with the Quantum Realm, the place where Hank's wife Janey Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years of her life and has no interest in going back, particularly when it comes to explaining her past or unleashing new Marvel Cinematic Universe big bad Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, who is quite frankly amazing in this movie and brings a real sense of big drama to his role, not to mention all the various - oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING, I forgot that legal disclaimer -versions of Kang that he shows off, including Immortus, Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion and Victor Timely).Everyone soon gets pulled into that Quantum Realm and becomes part of the war between its inhabitants, with good rebels Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, who was already part of the MCU as Kimball in Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., as well as Major Sarah Grey in the DC superhero TV series Black Lightning and a comms officer on The Mandalorian; if you really want me to go full geek, she's a member of former Micronauts leader Commander Arcturus Rann's Enigma Force alongside other non-Mego owned characters Marionette and Bug; one more semicolon but man, this movie is as close as we're ever getting to a Michael Golden-era Micronauts movie), telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper; he's not Quasar, as many Marvel fans thought, but when he does pull a password out of someone's mind at one point, it's 18147, which would be Avengers #181, Scott Lang's first appearance, and a shout out to the aforementioned Marvel Premiere #47), the slime creature with no holes named Veb (David Dastmalchian, who was Kurt in the last two Ant-Man movies, Abra Kadabra on The Flash and Polka Dot Man in Suicide Squad), the flashlight head Xolum (James Cutler) and oh yeah, there's Bill Murray as Lando Calrissian (I kid, he's Lord Krylar, another of the characters like Jentorra who come from K'ai, the microplanet where the Hulk met one of the loves of his life Jarella) battling Kang and his Tron: Legacy-looking soldiers like he's Baron Karza or something.Anyways, yes, this all feels rather like Star Wars but then again isn't Star Wars influenced if not ripped off from Jack Kirby's Fourth World? Kirby invented most of the MCU and rebelling against a dark authority is pretty much an archetype. Where this gets kind of operatic is that Ant-Man is, well, an ant against space god Kang and that's a battle that I never saw coming.I also never thought I'd see MODOK (Machine Organism Designed Only for Killing) in a movie, much less one that fully embraces the absolutely goofy idea of a giant head in a chair with weapons and baby legs. Also, this ends up being former Yellowjacket Darren Cross from the first movie and every time his real face shows up, it breaks the movie but it's a welcome break in the movie.You can imagine - and you'd be right - that the good guys win but this movie brings up an interesting idea that you can't just punch Kang, who lives his life across multiple timelines that are not linear and that this Kang may not be the worst of the many Kangs. Then Scott brushes it off and tries to enjoy some Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake (the fact that the ice cream chain has no tie-in flavor and yet had a Condorman flavor back in the 80s is kind of upsetting).In the same way that politics - nice socialism shoutout with the ants in this - just leads to people not listening to one another, a lot of folks have their minds made up about comic book movies which are really just mythology and should be seen as such. That said, this movie did what all popcorn films should: it entertained me. I think it's hilarious that one of the film's writers, Jeff Loveness, said that this movie is ""Jodorowsky's Dune within Marvel"" and there are not enough drugs in the world to show you what Alejandro Jodorowsky would do with a Marvel film but hey, he also did The Incal in comics form, so when you denigrate comics, keep in mind that a hero of cinema spent so much of his time there.I explained to my wife tonight that as a kid, there I never really wanted to get involved in human drama or how stressful some extended family members could be, so I just filled my life with comic books. Often when we talk on the phone, my mom will say, ""Do you remember this person,"" and the answer is no, I do not remember this person. However, if she asked, ""Was Wolverine really in World War 2?"" I could give her several anecdotes and explain how Black Widow could be young and yet still saved by Logan and Captain America in 1941.So yeah, I liked this movie."
positive,"Just finished watching the movie at the cinema and it was really awesome. Great fun and a lot of sci fi. Yes, it wasn't a grand plot like end-game. But still very entertaining and packed. Movie was clean and story was good. Plus it ties to the next phase of marvel movies. I assume low reviews are because people were comparing it to some great ones as the story could have been better and perhaps some might think it's a little random. But for those who are not so attached to the perfect marvel story. It's great. I would definitely give it a go. I watched it in 3D and CGI and effects were also pretty good. There are 2 credit scenes. Enjoy :)"
positive,"Aa a solo movie ye ek acchi movie hai...
Acchi comedy+ badiya action seen hai...Kang the conqueror 🔥🤙 like ek baap level villen ki filling deta he ye banda .End fight.... Kang v/s Lang are amazing 😍It is best antman movie in terms of action.This film have two post credit scene

But hamko iss picture ko as a solo movie Leni chahiye....it is a good movie i give 9/10👍😊"
positive,"We go down into the quantum world and enter planet cgi. Apart from the actors everything is CGI. There are strange creatures and landscapes. There are people who for the most part are similar to human, body, 2 arms, 2 legs etc. But with various different heads. There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.The plot is acceptable and the villain is great. He's definitely menacing. They're so confident of him they say he'll be back.So enjoy. Ant-man and the wasp will win but they left a let out for a sequel."
negative,"With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10
Letterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters."
positive,"This movie was great. The cgi gave me a little bit of a headache but not a migraine or anything. Also this movie is more serious instead of funny. They have jokes in the movie every now and then, but not so much. I don't really like how they handled
M. O. D. O. K. But he was funny and has an exciting return from a previous character. Kang is really scary and disturbing. There is two bonus scenes in total. One of them is a great way to show the future of the multiverse saga and the second one made me jump out of my seat because I was so happy. This film was a great way to open up phase five.8/10."
positive,"Jonathan Majors performance as 'Kang The Conqueror' is praise worthy, he delivers it with great intensity. Kang chaos is kicked off for the 'Multiverse Saga', with this entry movie of MCU Phase 5. Entertainment is filled with humorous comedy and action that MCU delivers as always. Adventure of quantum realm with good screen time is key to this movie, and you will love to see good family drama enhanced. Lower your expectation and enjoy this movie in 3D, I don't understand why is this movie getting such rotten reviews. Wait until last before getting of your seats, those two P. C. S . Is awesome, it won't let you disappoint."
negative,"Where do you start with Quantumania?It's an absolute mess of a movie and the demise of the Marvel Universe speeds up.The biggest threat to the multiverse and beyond isn't Kang or Thanos or Dr. Doom or whoever.It's the writing committees that have pretty much written everything since End Game.It's been downhill since then with a few decent moments in between.Quantumania is terrible. Wait for it to show on Disney if you must. Or, you could do yourself a favour and give it a wide berth. It has none of the charm of the previous two films and absolute zero jeopardy.There is nothing on the line because Kang can jump back and forward through time through multiple personalities. So nothing matters."
